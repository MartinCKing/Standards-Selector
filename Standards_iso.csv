,ISO 13485:2016,Medical devices  Quality management systems  Requirements for regulatory purposes,"ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life-cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. technical support). ISO 13485:2016 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide product, including quality management system-related services to such organizations.
Requirements of ISO 13485:2016 are applicable to organizations regardless of their size and regardless of their type except where explicitly stated. Wherever requirements are specified as applying to medical devices, the requirements apply equally to associated services as supplied by the organization.
The processes required by ISO 13485:2016 that are applicable to the organization, but are not performed by the organization, are the responsibility of the organization and are accounted for in the organization's quality management system by monitoring, maintaining, and controlling the processes.
If applicable regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulatory requirements can provide alternative approaches that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity to ISO 13485:2016 reflect any exclusion of design and development controls.
If any requirement in Clauses 6, 7 or 8 of ISO 13485:2016 is not applicable due to the activities undertaken by the organization or the nature of the medical device for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement in its quality management system. For any clause that is determined to be not applicable, the organization records the justification as described in 4.2.2.",https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html,Published

,ISO 3826-2:2008,Plastics collapsible containers for human blood and blood components  Part 2: Graphical symbols for use on labels and instruction leaflets,"ISO 3826-2:2008 addresses symbols that may be used to convey certain items of information related to medical devices dedicated to blood collection processes and storage. The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device. Many countries require that their own language be used to display textual information with medical devices. This raises problems to device manufacturers and users.
The symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.
Manufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.
ISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.
ISO 3826-2:2008 may also be of assistance to different stages of the blood supply chain, e.g.:

distributors of blood collection devices (manual or automated) or other representatives of manufacturers;
blood centres and distribution centres to simplify and secure the operating procedures.

Guidance for the development of in vitro test methods is included in an informative annex to ISO 7198:2016. It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
NOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.
It is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.
Vascular prostheses that are made of synthetic textile materials and synthetic non-textile materials are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
While vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.
Compound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
Endovascular prostheses implanted using catheter delivery and non-direct visualization are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.

The valve component of valved conduits constructed with a tubular vascular graft component, and the combination of the valved component and the tubular vascular graft component, are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It can be helpful in identifying the appropriate evaluation of the tubular vascular graft component of a valved conduit but specific requirements and testing are not described for these devices.
Cardiac and pericardial patches, vascular stents, accessory devices such as anastomotic devices, staplers, tunnelers and sutures, and pledgets are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
NOTE          Requirements for vascular stents are specified in ISO 25539‑2.
Requirements regarding cell seeding are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. Tissue engineered vascular prostheses that contain or are manufactured using cells present many distinct manufacturing (e.g. aseptic processing, cell seeding, etc.) and testing issues than those produced with synthetic or non-viable biological materials.

ISO 22675:2016 is suitable for the assessment of the conformity of prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units with the strength requirements specified in 4.4 of ISO 22523:2006 (see NOTE 1). Prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units on the market, which have demonstrated their compliance with the strength requirements specified in 4.4 of ISO 22523:2006 through submission to the relevant tests of ISO 10328:2006, need not be retested to this International Standard.
WARNING ? ISO 22675:2016 is not suitable to serve as a guide for the selection of a specific ankle-foot device or foot unit in the prescription of an individual lower limb prosthesis! Any disregard of this warning can result in a safety risk for amputees.
ISO 22675:2016 primarily specifies a cyclic test procedure for ankle-foot devices and foot units of external lower limb prostheses, distinguished by the potential to realistically simulate those loading conditions of the complete stance phase of walking from heel strike to toe-off that are relevant to the verification of performance requirements such as strength, durability and service life.
This potential is of particular importance for the assessment of the performance of a variety of recent designs of ankle-foot devices and foot units with specific characteristics that will only develop under realistic conditions of loading.
In addition, ISO 22675:2016 specifies a static test procedure for prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units, consisting of a static proof test and a static ultimate strength test, distinguished, besides other features, (see NOTE 2) by the potential to generate heel and forefoot forces at lines of action conforming to those occurring at the instants of maximum heel and forefoot loading during the cyclic test.
The loading conditions addressed in the third paragraph are characterized by a loading profile determined by the resultant vector of the vertical and horizontal (A-P) ground reaction forces and by a locomotion profile determined by the tibia angle.
The test loading conditions specified in this International Standard are characterized by standardized formats of these loading and locomotion profiles, to be uniformly applied by the cyclic and static test procedures to each sample of ankle-foot device or foot unit submitted for test.",https://www.iso.org/standard/70203.html,Published

Moreover, testing filamentous fungi (moulds) introduces several additional problems in standardization not addressed by the current procedure. Those methods are beyond the scope of this document.
This document describes the broth micro-dilution reference method, which can be implemented by either of two pathways. One pathway involves visual determination of MICs (CLSI method)[1][5]; the second pathway involves spectrophotometric determination of MICs (EUCAST method)[2][10]. The MIC reflects the activity of the drug under the described test conditions and can be interpreted for clinical management purposes by taking into account other factors, such as drug pharmacology or antifungal resistance mechanisms. In addition, MIC distributions can be used to define wild type or non-wild type fungal populations. Clinical interpretation of the MIC value is beyond the scope of this document; interpretive category breakpoints specific to the CLSI- and EUCAST-derived methods can be found by consulting the latest interpretive tables provided by the organizations[5][15]. Routine susceptibility testing methods or diagnostic test devices can be compared with this reference method in order to ensure comparable and reliable results for validation or registration purposes.",https://www.iso.org/standard/79379.html,Published
,ISO 17511:2020,In vitro diagnostic medical devices  Requirements for establishing metrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators trueness control materials and human samples,"This document specifies technical requirements and documentation necessary to establish metrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators, trueness control materials and human samples for quantities measured by IVD MDs. The human samples are those intended to be measured, as specified for each IVD MD. Metrological traceability of values for quantities in human samples extends to the highest available reference system component, ideally to RMPs and certified reference materials (CRMs).
All parties having a role in any of the steps described in a calibration hierarchy for an IVD MD are subject to the requirements described. These parties include but are not limited to manufacturers (of IVD MDs), RMP developers (see ISO 15193), RM producers (see ISO 15194), and reference/calibration laboratories (see ISO 15195) supporting calibration hierarchies for IVD MDs.
NOTE 1      Producers of RMs intended for use in standardization or calibration of IVD MDs include commercial and non-commercial organizations producing RMs for use by many end-users of IVD MDs and/or calibration laboratories, or for use by a single end-user medical laboratory, as in the case of a measurement standard (calibrator) intended to be used exclusively for calibration of a laboratory-developed MP.
This document is applicable to:
a)   all IVD MDs that provide measurement results in the form of numeric values, i.e. rational (ratio) and/or differential (interval) scales, and counting scales.
b)   IVD MDs where the measurement result is reported as a qualitative value established with a ratio of two measurements (i.e. the signal from a specimen being tested and the signal from a RM with a specified concentration or activity at the cut-off), or a counting scale, with corresponding decision threshold(s). This also includes IVD MDs where results are categorized among ordinal categories based on pre-established quantitative intervals for a quantity.
c)   RMs intended for use as trueness control materials for verification or assessment of calibration of IVD MDs, i.e. some commutable CRMs and some external quality assessment (EQA) materials (if so indicated in the RM's intended use statement).
d)   IVD MD-specific calibrators and trueness control materials with assigned values, intended to be used together with a specified IVD MD.
e)   IVD MDs as described in a) and b), where no end-user performed calibration is required (i.e. when the manufacturer performs a factory calibration of the IVD MD).
This document is not applicable to:
a)   calibrators and trueness control materials for IVD MDs which, due to their formulation, are known to have zero amount of measurand;
b)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories to assess the imprecision of an IVD MD, either its repeatability or reproducibility, and/or for assessing changes in IVD MD results compared to a previously established calibration condition;
c)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories and which are supplied with intervals of suggested acceptable values that are not metrologically traceable to higher order reference system components;
d)   properties reported as nominal scales and ordinal scales, where no magnitude is involved.
NOTE 2  Nominal scales are typically used to report e.g. identity of blood cell types, microorganism types, identity of nucleic acid sequences, identity of urine particles.
NOTE 3  Ordinal scales are often applied to results differentiated into dichotomous groupings (e.g. ?sick' vs. ?healthy'), and occasionally to results differentiated into non-dichotomous categories where the result categories are rank-ordered but the rank-ordered categories cannot be differentiated in terms of relative degree of difference, e.g. negative, +1, +2, +3 for grading of presence of haemoglobin in urine specimens by visual observation.",https://www.iso.org/standard/69984.html,Published

This part of ISO 10993 can also be applied to medical devices that are intended to be used topically in clinical indications where the surface or lining might have been breached, in order to evaluate local tissue responses.
The local effects are evaluated by a comparison of the tissue response caused by a test sample to that caused by control materials used in medical devices whose clinical acceptability and biocompatibility characteristics have been established. The objective of the test methods is to characterize the history and evolution of the tissue response after implantation of a medical device/biomaterial including final integration or absorption/degradation of the material. In particular for degradable/absorbable materials, the degradation characteristics of the material and the resulting tissue response should be determined.
ISO 10993-6:2016 does not deal with systemic toxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity or mutagenicity.

IEC 60335-2-34:2024 deals with the safety of sealed (hermetic and semi-hermetic type) motor-compressors, their protection and control systems, if any, which are intended for use in equipment for household and similar purposes and which conform with the standards applicable to such equipment. It applies to motor-compressors tested separately, under the most severe conditions that can be expected to occur in normal use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase motor-compressors and 600 V for multi-phase, 600 V direct-current (DC) motor-compressors. This standard also covers – multi-speed motor-compressors, that are motor-compressors, the speed of which can be set to different values; – variable capacity motor-compressors that are motor-compressors where the capacity of the compressor is controlled at fixed speeds. Examples of equipment which contain motor-compressors are – tumble dryers (IEC 60335-2-11); – refrigerating appliances, ice-cream appliances and ice-makers (IEC 60335-2-24); – electrical heat pumps, air-conditioners and dehumidifiers (IEC 60335-2-40); – commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines (IEC 60335-2-75); – commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or compressor (IEC 60335-2-89); – refrigerating equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use (IEC 61010-2-011); – professional ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118); – professional systems and heat pumps (ISO 5149-2); This standard does not supersede the requirements of standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the motor-compressor is used. However, if the motor-compressor type used complies with this standard, it will not be necessary for the tests for the motor-compressor specified in the particular appliance standard to be made in the particular appliance or assembly. If the motor-compressor control system is associated with the particular appliance control system, additional tests could be necessary on the end product. So far as is practical, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by motor-compressors used in appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, it does not in general take into account – the use of appliances by young children or infirm persons without supervision; – playing with the appliances by young children. Attention is drawn to the fact that – for motor-compressors intended to be used in appliances in vehicles or on board ships, additional requirements could be necessary; – motor-compressors used in appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas), additional require¬ments could be necessary; – in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.

,IEC 60601-1-9:2007+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2020 CSV,Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-9: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral Standard: Requirements for environmentally conscious design,"IEC 60601-1-9:2007+A1:2013+A2:2020 The objective of this collateral standard is to improve the environmental impact for the entire range of medical electrical equipment, taking into account all stages of the product life cycle: - product specification; - design; - manufacturing; - sales, logistics, installation; - use; - end of life management. This means protecting the environment and human health from hazardous substances, conserving raw materials and energy, minimizing the generation of waste, as well as minimizing the adverse environmental impacts associated with waste. The criteria needed to reach this goal must be integrated into all stages of the medical electrical equipment life cycle from the specification stage to end of life management. The environmental impacts of me equipment through all life-cycle stages are determined from the medical electrical equipment's environmental aspects defined during the identification of need, product planning, and design stages. Consideration of environmental aspects as early as possible in these stages can produce numerous benefits that might include lower costs, stimulation of innovation and creativity, and increased knowledge about the product. It can also provide new business opportunities, and improved product quality as well as reduction of adverse environmental impacts. The assessment of the environmental aspects and impacts of medical electrical equipment is a developing science and it is anticipated that this collateral standard will require periodic updating as the science develops. The requirements given in this collateral standard do not replace national or international laws and regulations. Environmental protection is one element of the overall risk management process as required by the general standard. The acceptability of medical electrical equipment's environmental impacts are balanced against other factors, such as the product's intended function, performance, safety, cost, marketability, quality, legal and regulatory requirements. This balance can differ depending on the intended function of the medical electrical equipment. For example, a solution appropriate for life-saving or life-supporting medical electrical equipment might not be appropriate for a device intended to correct a minor ailment. A manufacturer of medical electrical equipment might have to justify, as a result of risk management, that a medical benefit outweighs the associated adverse environmental impacts. This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2007), its amendment 1 (2013) and its amendment 2 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060601-1-9%3A2007%2BAMD1%3A2013%2BAMD2%3A2020%20CSV,

This document provides the basic concepts that are valid for all application domains using IEC 61850. Domain specific concepts are defined in other technical reports as in the document range of IEC 61850-7-5xx; as an example, IEC 61850-7-500 describes modelling concepts for functions related to substation automation. On one side the number of potential topics for cross-domain modelling may be very high but on the other side it may be limited by domain specific restrictions often created by the historical evolution of IEC 61850 in the domains. The first topic selected is the common control of power utility primary objects by means of the power utility automation systems based mainly on the long experience in substation automation systems. Common attributes for reliable power utility automation systems in all domains are quality and health. A special function having a broad application range in power utility automation systems is the scheduling of services as provided by the domain distributed energy resources (DER) used in smart grids, especially also for electric mobility. Not yet so much discussed in the context of IEC 61850 but very important for all IEDs is the impact of restart (power cycle) on the data model parameters.

The accompanying report, IEC 60977, however, does suggest that many of the test procedures are appropriate for acceptance tests.  The measurement conditions described in the present standard differ from those previously in use. This applies particularly to the phantom position for measurements and the measurement of distances from the isocentre. These new conditions should be substituted for and not be added to previous methods.  This standard specifies test procedures for the determination and disclosure of functional performance characteristics, knowledge of which is deemed necessary for proper application and use of a medical electron accelerator and which are to be declared in the accompanying documents together with the greatest deviation or variation to be expected under specific conditions in normal use. A format for presentation of functional performance values is given in Annex A.  It is recognized that inaccuracies in the test methods must be allowed for when assessing performance. However, it was not felt to be advisable to combine the errors into an overall performance tolerance but to keep them separate in the expectation that more accurate test methods will be evolved.  It is not intended that this standard should in any way inhibit the future development of new designs of equipment which may have operating modes and parameters different from those described herein, provided that such equipment achieves equivalent levels of performance for the treatment of patients.  Except where otherwise stated this standard assumes that the medical electron accelerators have an isocentric gantry. Where the equipment is non-isocentric, the description of performance and test methods may need to be suitably adapted.  This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1989. It constitutes a technical revision.  This second edition includes the addition of performance standards and test methods relating to the following new technologies:  - dynamic beam delivery techniques, such as moving beam radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and programmable wedge fields;  - stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) / stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS);  - use of electronic imaging devices.  This standard, together with IEC TR 60977, should be read in conjunction with IEC 60601-2-1.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060976%3A2007,

For HIGH VOLTAGES greater than 50 kV, this document applies to X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES with tungsten or tungsten-alloy TARGETS only. IEC 60522-1:2021 defines the concept of PERMANENT FILTRATION of X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES, and it defines the term FILTERING MATERIAL. Methods are given to determine the PERMANENT FILTRATION of an X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY and for determining the QUALITY EQUIVALENT FILTRATION of FILTERING MATERIALS. It contains requirements for statements of compliance of X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES in ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS and for markings on X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES, and for indications and statements of compliance of FILTERING MATERIAL. IEC 60522-1:2020 cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC 60522 published in 1999. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the IEC 60522:1999: The scope of the IEC 60522-1 has been changed with respect to second edition of the IEC 60522 as follows: a) As radiotherapy standards do not reference IEC 60522, radiotherapy is no longer in the scope. Consequently, the HIGH VOLTAGE is limited to 150 kV, and copper is no longer used as reference material. b) While IEC 60522:1999 covers only PERMANENT FILTRATION, IEC 60522-1 also covers quite generally “material filtering the X-RAY BEAM incident on the PATIENT”. This concerns materials like ADDED FILTERS, table-tops, a breast COMPRESSION DEVICE, and materials in the BEAM LIMITING DEVICE. For these materials the defined term FILTERING MATERIAL has been introduced. c) In order to provide technical and scientific background and rationale on the content of IEC 60522-1, IEC TR 60522-2 was introduced.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060522-1%3A2020,

,IEC 60601-1-6:2010+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2020 CSV,Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-6: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral standard: Usability,"IEC 60601-1-6:2010+A1:2013+A2:2020 specifies a process for a manufacturer toanalyse, specify, design, verify and validate usability, as it relates to basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment. This usability engineering process assesses and mitigates risks caused by usability problems associated with correct use and use errors, i.e., normal use. It can be used to identify but does not assess or mitigate risks associated with abnormal use. If the usability engineering process detailed in this collateral standard has been complied with and the acceptance criteria documented in the usability validation plan have been met (see 5.9 of IEC 62366:2007), then the residual risks, as defined in ISO 14971, associated with usability of me equipment are presumed to be acceptable, unless there is objective evidence to the contrary (see 4.1.2 of IEC 62366:2007). The object of this collateral standard is to specify general requirements that are in addition to those of the general standard and to serve as the basis for particular standards. This document cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC 60601-1-6 which has been technically revised. It was revised to align with the usability engineering process in IEC 62366. To allow for equipment manufacturers and testing organizations to make products and to equip themselves for conducting revised tests in accordance with this third edition, it is recommended by SC 62A that the content of this document not be adopted for mandatory implementation earlier than 3 years from the date of publication for equipment newly designed and not earlier than 5 years from the date of publication for equipment already in production.

,IEC 60601-1-9:2007+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2020 CSV,Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-9: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral Standard: Requirements for environmentally conscious design,"IEC 60601-1-9:2007+A1:2013+A2:2020 The objective of this collateral standard is to improve the environmental impact for the entire range of medical electrical equipment, taking into account all stages of the product life cycle: - product specification; - design; - manufacturing; - sales, logistics, installation; - use; - end of life management. This means protecting the environment and human health from hazardous substances, conserving raw materials and energy, minimizing the generation of waste, as well as minimizing the adverse environmental impacts associated with waste. The criteria needed to reach this goal must be integrated into all stages of the medical electrical equipment life cycle from the specification stage to end of life management. The environmental impacts of me equipment through all life-cycle stages are determined from the medical electrical equipment's environmental aspects defined during the identification of need, product planning, and design stages. Consideration of environmental aspects as early as possible in these stages can produce numerous benefits that might include lower costs, stimulation of innovation and creativity, and increased knowledge about the product. It can also provide new business opportunities, and improved product quality as well as reduction of adverse environmental impacts. The assessment of the environmental aspects and impacts of medical electrical equipment is a developing science and it is anticipated that this collateral standard will require periodic updating as the science develops. The requirements given in this collateral standard do not replace national or international laws and regulations. Environmental protection is one element of the overall risk management process as required by the general standard. The acceptability of medical electrical equipment's environmental impacts are balanced against other factors, such as the product's intended function, performance, safety, cost, marketability, quality, legal and regulatory requirements. This balance can differ depending on the intended function of the medical electrical equipment. For example, a solution appropriate for life-saving or life-supporting medical electrical equipment might not be appropriate for a device intended to correct a minor ailment. A manufacturer of medical electrical equipment might have to justify, as a result of risk management, that a medical benefit outweighs the associated adverse environmental impacts.

It establishes: - parameters related to thermal and non-thermal exposure aspects of diagnostic ultrasonic fields; - methods for the determination of an exposure parameter relating to temperature rise in theoretical tissue-equivalent models, resulting from absorption of ultrasound; - methods for the determination of an exposure parameter appropriate to certain non-thermal effects. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. Major changes with respect to the previous edition include the following: - The methods of determination set out in the first edition of this standard were based on those contained in the American standard for Real-Time Display of Thermal and Mechanical Acoustic Output Indices on Diagnostic Ultrasound Equipment (ODS) and were intended to yield identical results. While this second edition also follows the ODS in principal and uses the same basic formulae and assumptions (see Annex A), it contains a few significant modifications which deviate from the ODS. - One of the primary issues dealt with in preparing this second edition of IEC 62359 was ""missing"" TI equations. In Edition 1 there were not enough equations to make complete ""at-surface"" and ""below-surface"" summations for TIS and TIB in combined-operating modes. Thus major changes with respect to the previous edition are related to the introduction of new calculations of thermal indices to take into account both ""at-surface"" and ""below-surface"" thermal effects. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2011 have been included in this copy. This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2010) and its amendment 1 (2017).

IEC 61828:2021 relates to focusing ultrasonic transducers operating in the frequency range appropriate to medical ultrasound (0,5 MHz to 40 MHz) for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. It shows how the characteristics of the transmitted field of transducers can be described from the point of view of design, as well as measured by someone with no prior knowledge of the construction details of a particular device. The transmitted ultrasound field for a specified excitation is measured by a hydrophone in either a standard test medium (for example, water) or in a given medium. This document applies only to media where the field behaviour is essentially like that in a fluid (i.e. where the influence of shear waves and elastic anisotropy is small), including soft tissues and tissue-mimicking gels. Any aspects of the field that affect their theoretical description or are important in design are also included. These definitions would have use in scientific communications, system design and description of the performance and safety of systems using these devices. IEC 61828:2021 incorporates definitions from other related standards where possible, and supplies more specific terminology, both for defining focusing characteristics and for providing a basis for measurement of these characteristics.

,IEC TS 62736:2023 RLV,Ultrasonics - Pulse-echo scanners - Simple methods for periodic testing to verify stability of an imaging system's elementary performance,"IEC TS 62736:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.  IEC TS 62736:2023 specifies requirements and methods for periodic testing of the quality of diagnostic medical ultrasound systems using reflection-mode (pulse-echo) imaging. Image measurement and interpretation workstations are included. This document includes minimum sets of such tests intended for frequent users of medical ultrasound systems, for quality assurance professionals in their organizations, or those hired from other quality-control and/or service-provider organizations. The procedures are for a wide range of more common diagnostic ultrasound systems, currently operating from 1 MHz to 40 MHz, although available phantoms meet the specifications only from 1 MHz to 23 MHz. The tests are defined in three levels, with the simplest and most cost-effective performed most frequently: - Level 1 comprises five quick tests/observations to be performed daily to monthly by those normally operating the systems. - Level 2 includes one necessary test for all systems in addition to those of Level 1, two Level 1 tests performed more rigorously, two tests that are for special situations or equipment, and one that is just optional, included because it is highly developed. Level 2 tests are performed annually by those with meaningful quality assurance training. - Level 3 extends the two special situations tests to all systems, adds one optional test and includes a periodic review of the QA programme. Frequent distance-measurement accuracy tests are recommended in this document only for certain classes of position encoding that are not now known to be highly stable and without bias. QA in all dimensions is recommended in this document as the first test for such systems. The test methodology is applicable for transducers operating in the 1 MHz to 23 MHz frequency range. The types of transducers used with these scanners include a) electronic phased arrays, b) linear arrays, c) convex arrays, d) mechanical transducers, e) two-dimensional arrays operated in a 2D imaging mode, f) transducers operating in 3D imaging mode for a limited number of sets of reconstructed 2D images, and g) three-dimensional scanning transducers based on a combination of the above types. All tests on scanners considered here evaluate basic pulse-echo techniques and might detect most failures in other modes. Dedicated Doppler systems, or other systems for detection of blood motion, are excluded from this scope as specialized equipment is required to test them. Such test equipment can be specific to the intended application of the Doppler system. This document includes definition of terms and specifies methods for measuring the maximum relative depth of penetration of real-time ultrasound B MODE scanners, though this penetration measure is listed as less frequently applied. IEC TS 62736:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.

The above list is not exhaustive but indicative of the type of Standard to which this Technical Report provides guidance. The specific Standards above are not addressed individually but this Technical Report is synthesized from an analysis of their requirements and recommendations. 1.1 Within the scope This Technical Report assumes that a system is being developed in Ada to meet a standard listed above or one of a similar nature. The primary goal of this Technical Report is to translate general requirements into Ada specific ones. For example, a general standard might require that dynamic testing provides evidence of the execution of all the statements in the code of the application. In the case of generics, this is interpreted by this Technical Report to mean all instantiations of the generic should be executed. ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000 (E) 2 © ISO/IEC 2000 - All rights reserved This Technical Report is intended to provide guidance only, and hence there are no ?shalls'. However, this Technical Report identifies verification and validation issues which should be resolved and documented according to the sector-specific standards being employed. The following topics are within the scope of this Technical Report: _ the choice of features of the language which aid verification and compliance to the standards, _ identification of language features requiring additional verification steps, _ the use of tools to aid design and verification, _ issues concerning qualification of compilers for use on high integrity applications, _ tools, such as graphic design tools, which generate Ada source code which is accessible to users. Tools which generate Ada source code require special consideration. Where generated code may be modified or extended, verification of the extensions and overall system will be assisted if the guidelines have been taken into account. Even where modification is not planned, inspection and analysis of the generated code may be unavoidable unless the generator is trusted or ?qualified' according to an applicable standard. Finally, even if generated code is neither modified nor inspected, the overall verification process may be made more complicated if the code deviates from guidelines intended to facilitate testing and analysis. Potential users of such tools should evaluate their code generation against the guidance provided in this Technical Report. 1.2 Out of scope The following topics are considered to be out of scope with respect to this Technical Report: _ Domain-specific standards, _ Application-specific issues, _ Hardware and system-specific issues, _ Human factor",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=ISO/IEC%20TR%2015942%3A2000,

,IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV,Explosive atmospheres - Part 10-1: Classification of areas - Explosive gas atmospheres,"IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between IEC 60079-10-1:2020 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60079-10-1:2015 edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 31J experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2021 have been included in this copy.  IEC 60079-10-1:2020 is concerned with the classification of areas where flammable gas or vapour hazards may arise and may then be used as a basis to support the proper design, construction, operation and maintenance of equipment for use in hazardous areas. It is intended to be applied where there may be an ignition hazard due to the presence of flammable gas or vapour, mixed with air, but it does not apply to: a) mines susceptible to firedamp; b) the processing and manufacture of explosives; c) catastrophic failures or rare malfunctions which are beyond the concept of normality dealt with in this standard; d) rooms used for medical purposes; e) domestic premises; f) where a hazard may arise due to the presence of combustible dusts or combustible flyings but the principles may be used in assessment of a hybrid mixture. Flammable mists may form or be present at the same time as flammable vapour. In such case the strict application of the details in this document may not be appropriate. Flammable mists may also form when liquids not considered to be a hazard due to the high flash point are released under pressure. In these cases the classifications and details given in this document do not apply. For the purpose of this document, an area is a three-dimensional region or space. Atmospheric conditions include variations above and below reference levels of 101,3 kPa (1 013 mbar) and 20 °C (293 K), provided that the variations have a negligible effect on the explosion properties of the flammable substances. In any site, irrespective of size, there may be numerous sources of ignition apart from those associated with equipment. Appropriate precautions will be necessary to ensure safety in this context. This standard is applicable with judgement for other ignition sources but in some applications other safeguards may also need to be considered. E.g. larger distances may apply for naked flames when considering hot work permits. This document does not take into account the consequences of ignition of an explosive atmosphere except where a zone is so small that if ignition did occur it would have negligible consequences. This third edition of IEC 60079-10-1 cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2015, and constitutes a technical revision, see foreword for further details.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060079-10-1%3A2020%20CMV,

These requirements are in addition to the requirements for installations in non-hazardous areas. This document applies to all electrical Ex Equipment including fixed, transportable, portable and personal, and installations, permanent or temporary. This document does not apply to: • electrical installations in mines susceptible to firedamp; • inherently explosive situations and dust from explosives or pyrophoric substances (for example explosives manufacturing and processing); • rooms used for medical purposes; • electrical installations in areas where the hazard is due to flammable mist; and • installation of non-electrical Ex Equipment (unless being part of an equipment assembly according IEC TS 60079-46). No account is taken in this document of the toxic hazards that are associated with flammable gases, liquids and dusts in concentrations that are usually very much less than the lower flammable limit. In locations where personnel could be exposed to potentially toxic concentrations of flammable material, appropriate precautions are necessary. Such precautions are outside the scope of this document. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. Edition 6 is a major restructure and introduces a number of technical changes from the previous edition (2013), see Table 1 of the foreword for detailed information.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060079-14%3A2024,

,IEC 60352-9:2024,"Solderless connections - Part 9: Ultrasonically welded connections - General requirements, test methods and practical guidance","IEC 60352-9:2024 provides guidelines for welding and testing of ultrasonically welded connections and includes requirements, tests and practical guidance information. Ultrasonic welding is a form of cold friction welding that is becoming increasingly popular in many industries. This type of welding uses ultrasonic vibration to join materials together, creating a bond that is both strong and reliable. Ultrasonic welding has been identified as a process in ISO 4063-41 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The process of ultrasonic welding relies on high frequency ultrasound waves being used to create frictional heat at the connection point. High temperature is not required for this special method of welding, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to join two materials together. It also requires fewer steps than traditional methods, meaning it can be completed quickly and with minimal resources. Ultrasonic welding has been around for decades but only recently has become more widely utilized due to advances in technology and its availability at lower cost. It can be used on many different materials including plastics, rubbers, metals, textiles, and composites. Due to its precision and strong bonds it creates, it has become extremely popular in manufacturing processes such as automotive industry, electronics industry, furniture production and even medical device production. This document covers ultrasonically welded connections made with stranded or flexible wires (class 2, 5 or 6 per IEC 60228) of copper or copper alloy, as well as of aluminium or aluminium alloy. These welded metal-to-metal connections shall employ wires with cross-sectional area of 0,08 mm2 to 160 mm2 and shall not exceed a total cross-sectional area, in case of wire bundle, of 200 mm2. For aluminium or aluminium alloy wires, the minimum required cross-sectional area is 2,5 mm2. Additionally, information on materials, data from industrial experience and test procedures are included to ensure electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental conditions. Lastly, this document aims to achieve comparable results when using ultrasonic welding equipment with similar performance and specifications as specified by the termination manufacturer.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060352-9%3A2024,

It is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines the communications protocol used in the air interface. ISO/IEC 18000-6:2013 together with ISO/IEC 18000-61, ISO/IEC 18000-62, ISO/IEC 18000-63 and ISO/IEC 18000-64 specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, Interrogator-Talks-First (ITF) or tag-only-talks-after-listening (TOTAL) RFID system. The system comprises Interrogators, also known as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator receives information from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering an information signal to the Interrogator. The system is ITF, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal only after being directed to do so by an Interrogator, or TOTAL, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal upon entering an Interrogator's field after first listening for Interrogator modulation in order to determine if the system is ITF or not. ISO/IEC 18000-6:2013 contains one mode with four types. The detailed technical differences between the four types are shown in the associated parameter tables. Types A, B and C are ITF. Type A uses Pulse-Interval Encoding (PIE) in the forward link and an adaptive ALOHA collision-arbitration algorithm. Type B uses Manchester in the forward link and an adaptive binary-tree collision-arbitration algorithm. Type C uses PIE in the forward link and a random slotted collision-arbitration algorithm. Type D is TOTAL based on Pulse Position Encoding or Miller M=2 encoded subcarrier.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=ISO/IEC%2018000-6%3A2013,
