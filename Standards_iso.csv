,ISO 3826-2:2008,Plastics collapsible containers for human blood and blood components  Part 2: Graphical symbols for use on labels and instruction leaflets,"ISO 3826-2:2008 addresses symbols that may be used to convey certain items of information related to medical devices dedicated to blood collection processes and storage. The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device. Many countries require that their own language be used to display textual information with medical devices. This raises problems to device manufacturers and users.
The symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.
Manufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.
ISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.
ISO 3826-2:2008 may also be of assistance to different stages of the blood supply chain, e.g.:

distributors of blood collection devices (manual or automated) or other representatives of manufacturers;
blood centres and distribution centres to simplify and secure the operating procedures.

The use of these symbols is primarily intended for the medical device rather than the therapeutic product.",https://www.iso.org/standard/45611.html

,ISO/TR 28980:2007,Ophthalmic optics  Spectacle lenses  Parameters affecting lens power measurement,"The purpose of ISO/TR 28980:2007 is to explain the changes relating to power measurements in the revised editions of ISO 8980-1 and ISO 8980-2.
In order to illustrate the issues raised, an inter-laboratory power measurement study was conducted on ten different lenses measured by nine organizations worldwide. Twenty-five focimeters of different types were used. The test lenses were spherically powered allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC) hard resin lenses surfaced to -4,00 D, -2,00 D, 0,00 D, +2,00 D, and +4,00 D, each with an addition power of 2,50 D. Five were D28 bifocals and five were progressive power lenses. The measurements were front distance power, front near power, back distance power and back near power, for each lens and for each focimeter used. Each lens was measured nine times: five measurements taken without repositioning the lens and four measurements taken with the lens repositioned each time.
The assessed parameters were divided in three categories:
discrepancies due to focimeter design and measurement methods;systematic errors;random errors.
For each parameter, experimental results are given, as well as theoretical ones when needed. Measurement data include front distance portion power, front near portion power, back distance portion power and back near portion power.
Unless stated otherwise, in order to show relevant information, the results shown are for the D28 bifocals when no different behaviour was found for the progressive power lenses.",https://www.iso.org/standard/41182.html

associated with viable cellular components of products regulated as medicinal products, biologics, medical
devices and active implantable medical devices, or combinations thereof. It covers viable human materials of
autologous as well as allogeneic human origin, obtained from living or deceased donors.
For manufacturers of medical products containing viable cells of human origin, this International Standard
specifies procedures to be used in processing and handling, as well as those to be used in identifying the
hazards and hazardous situations associated with such cells, in order to estimate and evaluate the resulting
risks, to control these risks, and to monitor the effectiveness of that control. Furthermore, this International
Standard outlines the decision process for the residual risk acceptability, taking into account the balance of
residual risk and expected medical benefit as compared to available alternatives.
This International Standard provides requirements and guidance on risk management related to the hazards
typical of medical products manufactured utilizing viable human materials, such as:
a) contamination by bacteria, moulds, yeasts or parasites;
b) contamination by viruses;
c) contamination by agents causing Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE);
d) contaminating material responsible for undesired pyrogenic, immunological or toxicological reactions;
e) decomposition of the product and degradation products caused by inadequate handling;
f) hazards related to the tumorigenic potential of the cell types used;
g) complications resulting from unintended physiological and anatomical consequences (this includes
unintended migration of cells, unwanted release of biologically active substances such as hormones and
cytokines, and unintended interactions between cellular and non‑cellular components of the product);
h) failure of traceability;
i) complications resulting from the material eliciting an unintended immunogenic reaction.
For the evaluation of contamination with other unclassified pathogenic entities, similar principles might be applicable.
