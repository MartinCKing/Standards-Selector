,ISO 13485:2016,Medical devices  Quality management systems  Requirements for regulatory purposes,"ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life-cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. technical support). ISO 13485:2016 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide product, including quality management system-related services to such organizations.
Requirements of ISO 13485:2016 are applicable to organizations regardless of their size and regardless of their type except where explicitly stated. Wherever requirements are specified as applying to medical devices, the requirements apply equally to associated services as supplied by the organization.
The processes required by ISO 13485:2016 that are applicable to the organization, but are not performed by the organization, are the responsibility of the organization and are accounted for in the organization's quality management system by monitoring, maintaining, and controlling the processes.
If applicable regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulatory requirements can provide alternative approaches that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity to ISO 13485:2016 reflect any exclusion of design and development controls.
If any requirement in Clauses 6, 7 or 8 of ISO 13485:2016 is not applicable due to the activities undertaken by the organization or the nature of the medical device for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement in its quality management system. For any clause that is determined to be not applicable, the organization records the justification as described in 4.2.2.",https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html,Published

The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device. Many countries require that their own language be used to display textual information with medical devices. This raises problems to device manufacturers and users.
The symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.
Manufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.
ISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.
ISO 3826-2:2008 may also be of assistance to different stages of the blood supply chain, e.g.:

distributors of blood collection devices (manual or automated) or other representatives of manufacturers;
blood centres and distribution centres to simplify and secure the operating procedures.

It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
NOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.
It is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.

While vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.
Compound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.

The valve component of valved conduits constructed with a tubular vascular graft component, and the combination of the valved component and the tubular vascular graft component, are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It can be helpful in identifying the appropriate evaluation of the tubular vascular graft component of a valved conduit but specific requirements and testing are not described for these devices.
Cardiac and pericardial patches, vascular stents, accessory devices such as anastomotic devices, staplers, tunnelers and sutures, and pledgets are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
NOTE          Requirements for vascular stents are specified in ISO 25539‑2.
Requirements regarding cell seeding are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.

,ISO/TS 12417:2011,Cardiovascular implants and extracorporeal systems  Vascular device-drug combination products,"ISO/TS 12417:2011 specifies requirements for vascular device-drug combination products (VDDCPs) based upon current technical and medical knowledge. VDDCPs are medical devices with various clinical indications for use in the human vascular blood system. A VDDCP incorporates, as an integral part, substance(s) which, if used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product (drug product) but the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to that of the device and supports the primary mode of action of the device. With regard to safety, ISO/TS 12417 outlines requirements for intended performance, design attributes, materials, design evaluation, manufacturing, sterilization packaging, and information supplied by the manufacturer. For implanted products, ISO/TS 12417 should be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants. ISO/TS 12417 should also be considered as a supplement to relevant device-specific standards, such as the ISO 25539 series specifying requirements for endovascular devices. Requirements listed in ISO/TS 12417 also address VDDCPs that are not necessarily permanent implants.
Delivery systems or parts of the delivery system are included in the scope of ISO/TS 12417 if they comprise an integral component of the vascular device and if they are drug-covered (e.g. drug-covered balloon catheters and drug-covered guidewires).
Pumps and infusion catheters which do not contain drug coverings, and whose primary mode of action is to deliver a drug, are not addressed in ISO/TS 12417.
Procedures and devices used prior to and following the introduction of the VDDCP (e.g. balloon angioplasty devices) are excluded from the scope of ISO/TS 12417 if they do not affect the drug-related aspects of the device.
ISO/TS 12417 is not comprehensive with respect to the pharmacological evaluation of VDDCPs. Some information on the requirements of different related national and regional authorities is given in an annex.
Bioabsorbable components of VDDCPs (e.g. coatings) are addressed by ISO/TS 12417 in their connection with drug-related aspects of the device.

The measurements were front distance power, front near power, back distance power and back near power, for each lens and for each focimeter used. Each lens was measured nine times: five measurements taken without repositioning the lens and four measurements taken with the lens repositioned each time.
The assessed parameters were divided in three categories:
discrepancies due to focimeter design and measurement methods;systematic errors;random errors.
For each parameter, experimental results are given, as well as theoretical ones when needed. Measurement data include front distance portion power, front near portion power, back distance portion power and back near portion power.

The MIC can be a guide for the clinician, and reflects the activity of the drug under the described test conditions, by taking into account other factors, such as drug pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial resistance mechanisms. This allows categorisation of bacteria as ""susceptible"" (S), ""intermediate"" (I), or ""resistant"" (R). In addition, MIC distributions can be used to define wild type or non-wild type bacterial populations. Although clinical interpretation of the MIC value is beyond the scope of this document, modifications of the basic method are required for certain antimicrobial agent - bacteria combinations to facilitate clinical interpretation. These modifications are included in a separate annex of this document.
