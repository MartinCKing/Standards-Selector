,ISO 13485:2016,Medical devices  Quality management systems  Requirements for regulatory purposes,"ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life-cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. technical support). ISO 13485:2016 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide product, including quality management system-related services to such organizations.
Requirements of ISO 13485:2016 are applicable to organizations regardless of their size and regardless of their type except where explicitly stated. Wherever requirements are specified as applying to medical devices, the requirements apply equally to associated services as supplied by the organization.
The processes required by ISO 13485:2016 that are applicable to the organization, but are not performed by the organization, are the responsibility of the organization and are accounted for in the organization's quality management system by monitoring, maintaining, and controlling the processes.
If applicable regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulatory requirements can provide alternative approaches that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity to ISO 13485:2016 reflect any exclusion of design and development controls.
If any requirement in Clauses 6, 7 or 8 of ISO 13485:2016 is not applicable due to the activities undertaken by the organization or the nature of the medical device for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement in its quality management system. For any clause that is determined to be not applicable, the organization records the justification as described in 4.2.2.",https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html,Published

The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device. Many countries require that their own language be used to display textual information with medical devices. This raises problems to device manufacturers and users.
The symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.
Manufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.
ISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.
ISO 3826-2:2008 may also be of assistance to different stages of the blood supply chain, e.g.:

distributors of blood collection devices (manual or automated) or other representatives of manufacturers;

Guidance for the development of in vitro test methods is included in an informative annex to ISO 7198:2016. It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
NOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.
It is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.
Vascular prostheses that are made of synthetic textile materials and synthetic non-textile materials are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
While vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.
Compound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
Endovascular prostheses implanted using catheter delivery and non-direct visualization are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It includes information on the development of appropriate test methods for graft materials, referenced in ISO 25539‑1 for materials used in the construction of endovascular prostheses (i.e. stent-grafts).

The valve component of valved conduits constructed with a tubular vascular graft component, and the combination of the valved component and the tubular vascular graft component, are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It can be helpful in identifying the appropriate evaluation of the tubular vascular graft component of a valved conduit but specific requirements and testing are not described for these devices.
Cardiac and pericardial patches, vascular stents, accessory devices such as anastomotic devices, staplers, tunnelers and sutures, and pledgets are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
NOTE          Requirements for vascular stents are specified in ISO 25539‑2.
Requirements regarding cell seeding are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. Tissue engineered vascular prostheses that contain or are manufactured using cells present many distinct manufacturing (e.g. aseptic processing, cell seeding, etc.) and testing issues than those produced with synthetic or non-viable biological materials. The in vitro testing requirements that are outlined in ISO 7198:2016 can be a useful guide for certain testing requirements for these cell-based products.

In order to illustrate the issues raised, an inter-laboratory power measurement study was conducted on ten different lenses measured by nine organizations worldwide. Twenty-five focimeters of different types were used. The test lenses were spherically powered allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC) hard resin lenses surfaced to -4,00 D, -2,00 D, 0,00 D, +2,00 D, and +4,00 D, each with an addition power of 2,50 D. Five were D28 bifocals and five were progressive power lenses. The measurements were front distance power, front near power, back distance power and back near power, for each lens and for each focimeter used. Each lens was measured nine times: five measurements taken without repositioning the lens and four measurements taken with the lens repositioned each time.
The assessed parameters were divided in three categories:
discrepancies due to focimeter design and measurement methods;systematic errors;random errors.
For each parameter, experimental results are given, as well as theoretical ones when needed. Measurement data include front distance portion power, front near portion power, back distance portion power and back near portion power.

,ISO 16256:2021,Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems  Broth micro-dilution reference method for testing the in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against yeast fungi involved in infectious diseases,"This document describes a method for testing the susceptibility to antifungal agents of yeasts, including Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans, that cause infections. The reference method described here has not been used in studies of the yeast forms of dimorphic fungi, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis and/or Histoplasma capsulatum variety capsulatum. Moreover, testing filamentous fungi (moulds) introduces several additional problems in standardization not addressed by the current procedure. Those methods are beyond the scope of this document.
This document describes the broth micro-dilution reference method, which can be implemented by either of two pathways. One pathway involves visual determination of MICs (CLSI method)[1][5]; the second pathway involves spectrophotometric determination of MICs (EUCAST method)[2][10]. The MIC reflects the activity of the drug under the described test conditions and can be interpreted for clinical management purposes by taking into account other factors, such as drug pharmacology or antifungal resistance mechanisms. In addition, MIC distributions can be used to define wild type or non-wild type fungal populations. Clinical interpretation of the MIC value is beyond the scope of this document; interpretive category breakpoints specific to the CLSI- and EUCAST-derived methods can be found by consulting the latest interpretive tables provided by the organizations[5][15]. Routine susceptibility testing methods or diagnostic test devices can be compared with this reference method in order to ensure comparable and reliable results for validation or registration purposes.",https://www.iso.org/standard/79379.html,Published

The human samples are those intended to be measured, as specified for each IVD MD. Metrological traceability of values for quantities in human samples extends to the highest available reference system component, ideally to RMPs and certified reference materials (CRMs).
All parties having a role in any of the steps described in a calibration hierarchy for an IVD MD are subject to the requirements described. These parties include but are not limited to manufacturers (of IVD MDs), RMP developers (see ISO 15193), RM producers (see ISO 15194), and reference/calibration laboratories (see ISO 15195) supporting calibration hierarchies for IVD MDs.
NOTE 1      Producers of RMs intended for use in standardization or calibration of IVD MDs include commercial and non-commercial organizations producing RMs for use by many end-users of IVD MDs and/or calibration laboratories, or for use by a single end-user medical laboratory, as in the case of a measurement standard (calibrator) intended to be used exclusively for calibration of a laboratory-developed MP.
This document is applicable to:
a)   all IVD MDs that provide measurement results in the form of numeric values, i.e. rational (ratio) and/or differential (interval) scales, and counting scales.
b)   IVD MDs where the measurement result is reported as a qualitative value established with a ratio of two measurements (i.e. the signal from a specimen being tested and the signal from a RM with a specified concentration or activity at the cut-off), or a counting scale, with corresponding decision threshold(s). This also includes IVD MDs where results are categorized among ordinal categories based on pre-established quantitative intervals for a quantity.
c)   RMs intended for use as trueness control materials for verification or assessment of calibration of IVD MDs, i.e. some commutable CRMs and some external quality assessment (EQA) materials (if so indicated in the RM's intended use statement).
d)   IVD MD-specific calibrators and trueness control materials with assigned values, intended to be used together with a specified IVD MD.
e)   IVD MDs as described in a) and b), where no end-user performed calibration is required (i.e. when the manufacturer performs a factory calibration of the IVD MD).
This document is not applicable to:
a)   calibrators and trueness control materials for IVD MDs which, due to their formulation, are known to have zero amount of measurand;
b)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories to assess the imprecision of an IVD MD, either its repeatability or reproducibility, and/or for assessing changes in IVD MD results compared to a previously established calibration condition;
c)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories and which are supplied with intervals of suggested acceptable values that are not metrologically traceable to higher order reference system components;
d)   properties reported as nominal scales and ordinal scales, where no magnitude is involved.
NOTE 2  Nominal scales are typically used to report e.g. identity of blood cell types, microorganism types, identity of nucleic acid sequences, identity of urine particles.
NOTE 3  Ordinal scales are often applied to results differentiated into dichotomous groupings (e.g. ?sick' vs. ?healthy'), and occasionally to results differentiated into non-dichotomous categories where the result categories are rank-ordered but the rank-ordered categories cannot be differentiated in terms of relative degree of difference, e.g. negative, +1, +2, +3 for grading of presence of haemoglobin in urine specimens by visual observation.",https://www.iso.org/standard/69984.html,Published

This part of ISO 10993 can also be applied to medical devices that are intended to be used topically in clinical indications where the surface or lining might have been breached, in order to evaluate local tissue responses.
The local effects are evaluated by a comparison of the tissue response caused by a test sample to that caused by control materials used in medical devices whose clinical acceptability and biocompatibility characteristics have been established. The objective of the test methods is to characterize the history and evolution of the tissue response after implantation of a medical device/biomaterial including final integration or absorption/degradation of the material. In particular for degradable/absorbable materials, the degradation characteristics of the material and the resulting tissue response should be determined.
ISO 10993-6:2016 does not deal with systemic toxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity or mutagenicity.

,IEC 60601-1-9:2007+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2020 CSV,Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-9: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral Standard: Requirements for environmentally conscious design,"IEC 60601-1-9:2007+A1:2013+A2:2020 The objective of this collateral standard is to improve the environmental impact for the entire range of medical electrical equipment, taking into account all stages of the product life cycle: - product specification; - design; - manufacturing; - sales, logistics, installation; - use; - end of life management. This means protecting the environment and human health from hazardous substances, conserving raw materials and energy, minimizing the generation of waste, as well as minimizing the adverse environmental impacts associated with waste. The criteria needed to reach this goal must be integrated into all stages of the medical electrical equipment life cycle from the specification stage to end of life management. The environmental impacts of me equipment through all life-cycle stages are determined from the medical electrical equipment's environmental aspects defined during the identification of need, product planning, and design stages. Consideration of environmental aspects as early as possible in these stages can produce numerous benefits that might include lower costs, stimulation of innovation and creativity, and increased knowledge about the product. It can also provide new business opportunities, and improved product quality as well as reduction of adverse environmental impacts. The assessment of the environmental aspects and impacts of medical electrical equipment is a developing science and it is anticipated that this collateral standard will require periodic updating as the science develops. The requirements given in this collateral standard do not replace national or international laws and regulations. Environmental protection is one element of the overall risk management process as required by the general standard. The acceptability of medical electrical equipment's environmental impacts are balanced against other factors, such as the product's intended function, performance, safety, cost, marketability, quality, legal and regulatory requirements. This balance can differ depending on the intended function of the medical electrical equipment. For example, a solution appropriate for life-saving or life-supporting medical electrical equipment might not be appropriate for a device intended to correct a minor ailment. A manufacturer of medical electrical equipment might have to justify, as a result of risk management, that a medical benefit outweighs the associated adverse environmental impacts. This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2007), its amendment 1 (2013) and its amendment 2 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060601-1-9%3A2007%2BAMD1%3A2013%2BAMD2%3A2020%20CSV,

,IEC TR 61850-7-5:2021,Communication networks and systems for power utility automation - Part 7-5: IEC 61850 modelling concepts,"IEC TR 61850-7-5:2021, which is a technical report, establishes modelling concepts that help the user to understand how to apply the models defined in IEC 61850-7-4 and IEC 61850-7-3 to implement practical applications. This document provides the basic concepts that are valid for all application domains using IEC 61850. Domain specific concepts are defined in other technical reports as in the document range of IEC 61850-7-5xx; as an example, IEC 61850-7-500 describes modelling concepts for functions related to substation automation. On one side the number of potential topics for cross-domain modelling may be very high but on the other side it may be limited by domain specific restrictions often created by the historical evolution of IEC 61850 in the domains. The first topic selected is the common control of power utility primary objects by means of the power utility automation systems based mainly on the long experience in substation automation systems. Common attributes for reliable power utility automation systems in all domains are quality and health. A special function having a broad application range in power utility automation systems is the scheduling of services as provided by the domain distributed energy resources (DER) used in smart grids, especially also for electric mobility. Not yet so much discussed in the context of IEC 61850 but very important for all IEDs is the impact of restart (power cycle) on the data model parameters.

,IEC 60976:2007,Medical electrical equipment - Medical electron accelerators - Functional performance characteristics,"Applies to medical electron accelerators when used, for therapy purposes, in human medical practice.  This standard applies to medical electron accelerators which deliver a radiation beam of either X-radiation or electron radiation with nominal energies in the range 1 MeV to 50 MeV at maximum absorbed dose rates between 0,001 Gy s-1 and 1 Gy s-1 at 1 m from the radiation source and at normal treatment distances between 50 cm and 200 cm from the radiation source.  The present standard describes measurements and test procedures to be performed by the manufacturer at the design and construction stage of a medical electron accelerator but does not specify acceptance tests to be performed after installation at the purchaser's site. The accompanying report, IEC 60977, however, does suggest that many of the test procedures are appropriate for acceptance tests.  The measurement conditions described in the present standard differ from those previously in use. This applies particularly to the phantom position for measurements and the measurement of distances from the isocentre. These new conditions should be substituted for and not be added to previous methods.  This standard specifies test procedures for the determination and disclosure of functional performance characteristics, knowledge of which is deemed necessary for proper application and use of a medical electron accelerator and which are to be declared in the accompanying documents together with the greatest deviation or variation to be expected under specific conditions in normal use. A format for presentation of functional performance values is given in Annex A.  It is recognized that inaccuracies in the test methods must be allowed for when assessing performance. However, it was not felt to be advisable to combine the errors into an overall performance tolerance but to keep them separate in the expectation that more accurate test methods will be evolved.  It is not intended that this standard should in any way inhibit the future development of new designs of equipment which may have operating modes and parameters different from those described herein, provided that such equipment achieves equivalent levels of performance for the treatment of patients.  Except where otherwise stated this standard assumes that the medical electron accelerators have an isocentric gantry. Where the equipment is non-isocentric, the description of performance and test methods may need to be suitably adapted.  This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1989. It constitutes a technical revision.  This second edition includes the addition of performance standards and test methods relating to the following new technologies:  - dynamic beam delivery techniques, such as moving beam radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and programmable wedge fields;  - stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) / stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS);  - use of electronic imaging devices.

For HIGH VOLTAGES greater than 50 kV, this document applies to X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES with tungsten or tungsten-alloy TARGETS only. IEC 60522-1:2021 defines the concept of PERMANENT FILTRATION of X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES, and it defines the term FILTERING MATERIAL. Methods are given to determine the PERMANENT FILTRATION of an X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY and for determining the QUALITY EQUIVALENT FILTRATION of FILTERING MATERIALS. It contains requirements for statements of compliance of X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES in ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS and for markings on X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLIES, and for indications and statements of compliance of FILTERING MATERIAL. IEC 60522-1:2020 cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC 60522 published in 1999. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the IEC 60522:1999: The scope of the IEC 60522-1 has been changed with respect to second edition of the IEC 60522 as follows: a) As radiotherapy standards do not reference IEC 60522, radiotherapy is no longer in the scope. Consequently, the HIGH VOLTAGE is limited to 150 kV, and copper is no longer used as reference material. b) While IEC 60522:1999 covers only PERMANENT FILTRATION, IEC 60522-1 also covers quite generally “material filtering the X-RAY BEAM incident on the PATIENT”. This concerns materials like ADDED FILTERS, table-tops, a breast COMPRESSION DEVICE, and materials in the BEAM LIMITING DEVICE. For these materials the defined term FILTERING MATERIAL has been introduced. c) In order to provide technical and scientific background and rationale on the content of IEC 60522-1, IEC TR 60522-2 was introduced.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060522-1%3A2020,

,IEC 62359:2010+AMD1:2017 CSV,Ultrasonics - Field characterization - Test methods for the determination of thermal and mechanical indices related to medical diagnostic ultrasonic fields,"IEC 62359:2010+A1:2017 is applicable to medical diagnostic ultrasound fields. It establishes: - parameters related to thermal and non-thermal exposure aspects of diagnostic ultrasonic fields; - methods for the determination of an exposure parameter relating to temperature rise in theoretical tissue-equivalent models, resulting from absorption of ultrasound; - methods for the determination of an exposure parameter appropriate to certain non-thermal effects. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. Major changes with respect to the previous edition include the following: - The methods of determination set out in the first edition of this standard were based on those contained in the American standard for Real-Time Display of Thermal and Mechanical Acoustic Output Indices on Diagnostic Ultrasound Equipment (ODS) and were intended to yield identical results. While this second edition also follows the ODS in principal and uses the same basic formulae and assumptions (see Annex A), it contains a few significant modifications which deviate from the ODS. - One of the primary issues dealt with in preparing this second edition of IEC 62359 was ""missing"" TI equations. In Edition 1 there were not enough equations to make complete ""at-surface"" and ""below-surface"" summations for TIS and TIB in combined-operating modes. Thus major changes with respect to the previous edition are related to the introduction of new calculations of thermal indices to take into account both ""at-surface"" and ""below-surface"" thermal effects. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2011 have been included in this copy. This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2010) and its amendment 1 (2017). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2062359%3A2010%2BAMD1%3A2017%20CSV,

Required levels of performance for ACCEPTANCE TESTS are not provided for all tests. This document does not address – image quality assessment of MR EQUIPMENT with a static magnetic field intensity greater than 8 Tesla, if not otherwise stated, – image quality affected by MR-compatibility issues, – special diagnostic procedures such as flow imaging, perfusion, diffusion, radiotherapy and image-guided therapy applications, and – TYPE TESTS. The scope of this document is also limited to measuring image quality characteristics in images acquired on TEST DEVICES, not in PATIENT images. The measurement procedures specified in this document are directed to – MANUFACTURERS, who can demonstrate compliance by performing ACCEPTANCE and CONSTANCY TESTS as described by this document, – test houses, who can confirm performance of MR EQUIPMENT using methods described in this document, – regulatory authorities, who can reference this document, and – RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONS who want to perform ACCEPTANCE and CONSTANCY TESTS using methods described in this document. The essential image quality parameters and measurement methodologies defined in this document are – SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO, – UNIFORMITY, – SLICE THICKNESS in 2-D scanning, – 2-D GEOMETRIC DISTORTION, – SPATIAL RESOLUTION, and – GHOSTING ARTEFACTS. Each of these procedures can be performed standalone or in combination with any of the other procedures. This document describes the preferred measurement procedures. It also describes alternative normative methods in Annex A. The preferred test methods may be substituted with these alternative normative methods. If necessary, other methods not described in this document can be used, provided those other test methods are documented and validated against the methods described in the document: it means an analysis is done by comparison to the original method that demonstrates a similar, or better, level of sensitivity to the same parameter of interest and a similar, or better, level of robustness against unrelated parameters. All methods will produce quantitative results. The rationale to the preferred and alternate methods, and their pitfalls, are described in Annex B. This document also presents requirements for CONSTANCY TESTS suitable for MR EQUIPMENT quality assurance programs concerning essential image quality parameters. There are no preferred CONSTANCY TEST methods, to provide flexibility in using existing automated procedures where available, but suggested examples of test methods can be found in Annex A. This document places an emphasis on consistently repeatable, automated measuring tools that facilitate trend analysis and the frequent quick testing of a small set of important parameters that are sensitive to the overall operating characteristics of the MR EQUIPMENT.

,IEC TS 62736:2023 RLV,Ultrasonics - Pulse-echo scanners - Simple methods for periodic testing to verify stability of an imaging system's elementary performance,"IEC TS 62736:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.  IEC TS 62736:2023 specifies requirements and methods for periodic testing of the quality of diagnostic medical ultrasound systems using reflection-mode (pulse-echo) imaging. Image measurement and interpretation workstations are included. This document includes minimum sets of such tests intended for frequent users of medical ultrasound systems, for quality assurance professionals in their organizations, or those hired from other quality-control and/or service-provider organizations. The procedures are for a wide range of more common diagnostic ultrasound systems, currently operating from 1 MHz to 40 MHz, although available phantoms meet the specifications only from 1 MHz to 23 MHz. The tests are defined in three levels, with the simplest and most cost-effective performed most frequently: - Level 1 comprises five quick tests/observations to be performed daily to monthly by those normally operating the systems. - Level 2 includes one necessary test for all systems in addition to those of Level 1, two Level 1 tests performed more rigorously, two tests that are for special situations or equipment, and one that is just optional, included because it is highly developed. Level 2 tests are performed annually by those with meaningful quality assurance training. - Level 3 extends the two special situations tests to all systems, adds one optional test and includes a periodic review of the QA programme. Frequent distance-measurement accuracy tests are recommended in this document only for certain classes of position encoding that are not now known to be highly stable and without bias. QA in all dimensions is recommended in this document as the first test for such systems. The test methodology is applicable for transducers operating in the 1 MHz to 23 MHz frequency range. The types of transducers used with these scanners include a) electronic phased arrays, b) linear arrays, c) convex arrays, d) mechanical transducers, e) two-dimensional arrays operated in a 2D imaging mode, f) transducers operating in 3D imaging mode for a limited number of sets of reconstructed 2D images, and g) three-dimensional scanning transducers based on a combination of the above types. All tests on scanners considered here evaluate basic pulse-echo techniques and might detect most failures in other modes. Dedicated Doppler systems, or other systems for detection of blood motion, are excluded from this scope as specialized equipment is required to test them. Such test equipment can be specific to the intended application of the Doppler system. This document includes definition of terms and specifies methods for measuring the maximum relative depth of penetration of real-time ultrasound B MODE scanners, though this penetration measure is listed as less frequently applied. IEC TS 62736:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: a) expansion of the applicable types of transducers and the frequency range of application; b) extension of test protocols and image assessments, including for very-low-echo spheres; c) revision of phantom designs and their acoustic properties, consistent with the second edition of IEC TS 62791; d) inclusion of luminance tests for system-image display consistency at scanner and remote monitors; e) addition of special considerations for 3D-imaging transducers (Annex D) and workbook examples (Annex E).",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%20TS%2062736%3A2023%20RLV,

,ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000,Information technology - Programming languages - Guide for the use of the Ada programming language in high integrity systems,"1 Scope This Technical Report provides guidance on the use of Ada when producing high integrity systems. In producing such applications it is usually the case that adherence to guidelines or standards has to be demonstrated to independent bodies. These guidelines or standards vary according to the application area, industrial sector or nature of the risk involved. For safety applications, the international generic standard is [IEC 61508] of which part 3 is concerned with software. For security systems, the multi-national generic assessment guide is [ISO CD 15408]. For sector-specific guidance and standards there are: Airborne civil avionics: [DO-178B] Nuclear power plants: [IEC 880] Medical systems: [IEC 601-4] Pharmaceutical: [GAMP] For national/regional guidance and standards there are the following: UK Defence: [DS 00-55] European rail: [EN 50128] European security: [ITSEC] US nuclear: [NRC] UK automotive: [MISRA] US medical: [FDA] US space: [NASA] The above standards and guides are referred to as Standards in this Technical Report. The above list is not exhaustive but indicative of the type of Standard to which this Technical Report provides guidance. The specific Standards above are not addressed individually but this Technical Report is synthesized from an analysis of their requirements and recommendations. 1.1 Within the scope This Technical Report assumes that a system is being developed in Ada to meet a standard listed above or one of a similar nature. The primary goal of this Technical Report is to translate general requirements into Ada specific ones. For example, a general standard might require that dynamic testing provides evidence of the execution of all the statements in the code of the application. In the case of generics, this is interpreted by this Technical Report to mean all instantiations of the generic should be executed. ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000 (E) 2 © ISO/IEC 2000 - All rights reserved This Technical Report is intended to provide guidance only, and hence there are no ?shalls'. However, this Technical Report identifies verification and validation issues which should be resolved and documented according to the sector-specific standards being employed. The following topics are within the scope of this Technical Report: _ the choice of features of the language which aid verification and compliance to the standards, _ identification of language features requiring additional verification steps, _ the use of tools to aid design and verification, _ issues concerning qualification of compilers for use on high integrity applications, _ tools, such as graphic design tools, which generate Ada source code which is accessible to users. Tools which generate Ada source code require special consideration. Where generated code may be modified or extended, verification of the extensions and overall system will be assisted if the guidelines have been taken into account. Even where modification is not planned, inspection and analysis of the generated code may be unavoidable unless the generator is trusted or ?qualified' according to an applicable standard. Finally, even if generated code is neither modified nor inspected, the overall verification process may be made more complicated if the code deviates from guidelines intended to facilitate testing and analysis. Potential users of such tools should evaluate their code generation against the guidance provided in this Technical Report. 1.2 Out of scope The following topics are considered to be out of scope with respect to this Technical Report: _ Domain-specific standards, _ Application-specific issues, _ Hardware and system-specific issues, _ Human factor",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=ISO/IEC%20TR%2015942%3A2000,

,IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV,Explosive atmospheres - Part 10-1: Classification of areas - Explosive gas atmospheres,"IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between IEC 60079-10-1:2020 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60079-10-1:2015 edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 31J experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2021 have been included in this copy.  IEC 60079-10-1:2020 is concerned with the classification of areas where flammable gas or vapour hazards may arise and may then be used as a basis to support the proper design, construction, operation and maintenance of equipment for use in hazardous areas. It is intended to be applied where there may be an ignition hazard due to the presence of flammable gas or vapour, mixed with air, but it does not apply to: a) mines susceptible to firedamp; b) the processing and manufacture of explosives; c) catastrophic failures or rare malfunctions which are beyond the concept of normality dealt with in this standard; d) rooms used for medical purposes; e) domestic premises; f) where a hazard may arise due to the presence of combustible dusts or combustible flyings but the principles may be used in assessment of a hybrid mixture. Flammable mists may form or be present at the same time as flammable vapour. In such case the strict application of the details in this document may not be appropriate. Flammable mists may also form when liquids not considered to be a hazard due to the high flash point are released under pressure. In these cases the classifications and details given in this document do not apply. For the purpose of this document, an area is a three-dimensional region or space. Atmospheric conditions include variations above and below reference levels of 101,3 kPa (1 013 mbar) and 20 °C (293 K), provided that the variations have a negligible effect on the explosion properties of the flammable substances. In any site, irrespective of size, there may be numerous sources of ignition apart from those associated with equipment. Appropriate precautions will be necessary to ensure safety in this context. This standard is applicable with judgement for other ignition sources but in some applications other safeguards may also need to be considered. E.g. larger distances may apply for naked flames when considering hot work permits. This document does not take into account the consequences of ignition of an explosive atmosphere except where a zone is so small that if ignition did occur it would have negligible consequences. This third edition of IEC 60079-10-1 cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2015, and constitutes a technical revision, see foreword for further details.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060079-10-1%3A2020%20CMV,

,IEC 60352-9:2024,"Solderless connections - Part 9: Ultrasonically welded connections - General requirements, test methods and practical guidance","IEC 60352-9:2024 provides guidelines for welding and testing of ultrasonically welded connections and includes requirements, tests and practical guidance information. Ultrasonic welding is a form of cold friction welding that is becoming increasingly popular in many industries. This type of welding uses ultrasonic vibration to join materials together, creating a bond that is both strong and reliable. Ultrasonic welding has been identified as a process in ISO 4063-41 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The process of ultrasonic welding relies on high frequency ultrasound waves being used to create frictional heat at the connection point. High temperature is not required for this special method of welding, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to join two materials together. It also requires fewer steps than traditional methods, meaning it can be completed quickly and with minimal resources. Ultrasonic welding has been around for decades but only recently has become more widely utilized due to advances in technology and its availability at lower cost. It can be used on many different materials including plastics, rubbers, metals, textiles, and composites. Due to its precision and strong bonds it creates, it has become extremely popular in manufacturing processes such as automotive industry, electronics industry, furniture production and even medical device production. This document covers ultrasonically welded connections made with stranded or flexible wires (class 2, 5 or 6 per IEC 60228) of copper or copper alloy, as well as of aluminium or aluminium alloy. These welded metal-to-metal connections shall employ wires with cross-sectional area of 0,08 mm2 to 160 mm2 and shall not exceed a total cross-sectional area, in case of wire bundle, of 200 mm2. For aluminium or aluminium alloy wires, the minimum required cross-sectional area is 2,5 mm2. Additionally, information on materials, data from industrial experience and test procedures are included to ensure electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental conditions. Lastly, this document aims to achieve comparable results when using ultrasonic welding equipment with similar performance and specifications as specified by the termination manufacturer.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060352-9%3A2024,

An Interrogator receives information from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering an information signal to the Interrogator. The system is TOTAL, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal upon entering an Interrogator's field after first listening for Interrogator modulation in order to determine if the system is ITF or not. ISO/IEC 18000-64:2012 contains Type D. Type D is TOTAL based on Pulse Position Encoding or Miller M=2 encoded subcarrier. ISO/IEC 18000-64:2012 specifies  physical interactions (the signalling layer of the communication link) between Interrogators and tags, Interrogator and tag operating procedures, the collision arbitration scheme used to identify a specific tag in a multiple-tag environment.",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=ISO/IEC%2018000-64%3A2012,

ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the active air interface for these devices operating in the 433,92 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. ISO/IEC TR 18047 provides test methods for conformance with the various parts of ISO/IEC 18000. ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 contains the compliance measurements required to be fulfilled by a product in order to be compliant to ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009. ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009, but does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements. The test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case. The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 are the following:  mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances; parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.  The following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010:  parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements; high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).

Combination products are therapeutic or diagnostic medical products that combine drugs, devices, and/or biological products with one another. The FDA regulation became effective 22 July 2013 (21 CFR Part 4). Final guidance on CGMPs for combination products was issued in January 2017, and a list of alternative or streamlined mechanisms for compliance with CGMPs for combination products was later issued in September 2022 . This TIR, where appropriate, also considers best practices, guidelines, and standards used in both the United States and other regions. The overall goal of the TIR is to aid informed, risk-based decisions in establishing CGMP operating systems that support development, manufacture, premarket regulatory evaluation, and commercialization of combination products. It should be noted that, while the information contained in the TIR has been carefully considered, it is up to the individual manufacturer to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements that apply to its products.

Guidance is presented for signage and information to help identify persons with ambulatory medical devices and process them through the security checkpoint.   5.2 This practice is intended to help in the training of checkpoint screeners to address the concerns of persons with ambulatory medical devices and to respond to their needs.   5.3 This practice is intended to aid the medical community in advising medical device users who may be affected to identify themselves at security checkpoints so their concerns may be addressed.   5.4 This practice is intended to aid medical device manufacturers to provide consistent information for medical device users, patients, and checkpoint screeners. Scope   1.1 The following practice is intended to address the needs and concerns of persons with implanted, active, medical devices or active ambulatory medical devices, as well as passive implanted medical devices, while maintaining the integrity of the security checkpoint.   1.2 Active and passive implanted medical devices are being used at an increasing rate as a means to prolong and improve quality of life. Although these medical devices are typically designed to operate in the electromagnetic environment experienced in daily life, there is a potential for the disruption of active medical device function when exposed to certain electromagnetic fields emitted by commonly encountered electrically powered products, including handheld and walk-through metal detectors used in security checkpoint screening. In addition, some active or passive implanted devices may trigger the unintended alarm of the metal detector.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values shown in parentheses are for information only.   1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F561-19,"Standard Practice for  Retrieval and Analysis of Medical Devices, and Associated Tissues  and Fluids","Significance and Use   5.1 The investigation of retrieved implantable medical devices and adjacent tissues can be of value in the assessment of clinical complications associated with the use of a specific prosthetic device design; can expand the knowledge of clinical implant performance and interactions between implants and the body; provide information on implant performance and safety; and thus further the development of biocompatible implant materials and devices with improved performance. Comparison of wear patterns and wear particle morphology observed with retrievals and those observed with in vitro joint simulator tests can provide valuable insight into the validity of the in vitro simulation.   5.2 A significant portion of the information associated with a retrieved implant is obtained with detailed studies of the device-tissue interface healing response. Appropriate methods are provided to facilitate a study of the particles in the tissues, and chemical analysis for the byproducts of degradation of the implant, and histologic evaluation of the cellular response to the implant.   5.3 For the analysis to be accurate, it is essential that the device and associated tissues be removed minimizing as best as possible alteration of their form and structure. It is also essential that the tissues be handled in such a way as to avoid microbial or viral contamination of the work place or the investigator. The tissue-device interface may need to be stabilized with chemical fixation prior to separation of the device from it’s in-situ position. It is also highly recommended to document detailed information about the tissue specimens, including location of extraction. Standard protocols for the examination and collection of data are provided for retrieval and handling of implantable medical devices, as well as for specific types of materials in relation to their typical applications. For particular investigational programs, additional, more specific, protocols may be required. If special analytical techniques are employed, the appropriate procedures must be specified.   5.4 In order to interpret the analysis of materials and tissues, it is also essential to capture a minimum data set regarding the reason for device removal, method of removal, method and timing preservation and clinical findings and laboratory studies documenting device performance.   5.5 Planning of the overall retrieval analyses prior to execution of any of the protocols or methods within this practice is essential to maximize the overall effectiveness of the analyses. The plan shall be based on initial observations from the available clinical information, tissues, and implants. Subsequently, the plan may need to be revised based on results obtained throughout the analyses. Due to the potential interferences described in Section 6 , protocols and methods should be executed in a sequence such as to minimize the impact of interferences   5.6 Any destructive analysis of implants must be done so as to not destroy any features that may become the subject of litigation, in accordance with Practice E860 . This standard recommendation should be applied in accordance with state or national regulations or legal requirements regarding the handling and analysis of retrieved implants and tissues. Scope   1.1 This practice covers recommendations for the retrieval, handling, and analysis of implanted medical devices and associated specimens that are removed from human and animal subjects during revision surgery and at postmortem. This practice may be used for the analysis of any implant including inert, bioactive, resorbable, and tissue engineered products. This practice can also be used for analysis of specimens and fluids from in vitro tests, including those from wear tests and joint simulators. The aim is to provide guidance to minimize iatrogenic damage during the recovery and handling of the associated specimens which could obscure the investigational results. This practice is also intended to provide guidance as to gathering data at the proper time and circumstance.   1.2 This practice offers guidelines for the analysis of retrieved implants to limit damage to them, and to allow comparisons between investigational results from different studies. The protocols are divided into three stages, where Stage I is the minimum non-destructive analysis, Stage II is more complete non-destructive analysis, and Stage III is destructive analysis. Standard protocols for the examination and collection of data are provided for specific types of materials in relation to their typical applications. For particular investigational programs, additional, more specific, protocols may be required. If special analytical techniques are employed, the appropriate handling procedures must be specified. Note that regulations for handling of patient information, tissues, and retrieved devices will vary by geography.   1.3 This practice should be applied in accordance with pertinent regulations or legal requirements regarding the handling of patient data as well as the handling and analysis of retrieved implants and excised tissues, especially with regard to handling devices which may become involved in litigation, as in accordance with Practice E860 . Note that regulations for handling of patient information, tissues, and retrieved devices will vary by geography   1.4 A significant portion of the information associated with a retrieved implant device is often at the device-tissue interface or in the tissues associated with the implant and related organ systems. Attention should be given to the handling of adjacent tissues, so as not to interfere with study of the particles in the adjacent tissue, a chemical analysis for the byproducts of degradation of the implant, or a study of the cellular response to the implant.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  This standard may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. As a precautionary measure, explanted devices should be sterilized or minimally disinfected by an appropriate means that does not adversely affect the implant or the associated tissue that may be subject to subsequent analysis. A detailed discussion of precautions to be used in handling of human tissues can be found in ISO 12891-1. This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.7  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F3208-20,Standard Guide for Selecting Test Soils for Validation of Cleaning Methods for  Reusable Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide provides information on how to select the test soil(s) that best simulates clinical use for devices. The test soil(s) selected for the validation should be clinically relevant and simulate what the device/component will come into contact with during the clinical procedure.   5.2 This guide will help standardize the test soils used by medical device manufacturers when validating the cleaning procedures of reusable medical devices and reprocessing equipment   5.3 For devices that come into contact with blood, the simulated test soils are blood-based soils, such as those described under 7.1.1 - 7.1.2 .   5.4 For devices that come into contact with mucus, the simulated test soils are those described under 7.1.3 .   5.5 For devices that come in contact with soils of a source other than the patient (e.g., bone cement), the simulated test soils should be similar to those described in 7.2 . These can be used alone or in combination with 7.1 .   5.6 A combination of test soils may be used (e.g., blood with mucus) to simulate clinical soiling. For example, flexible endoscopes may come in contact with a different combination of sources of soiling (e.g., gastrointestinal (GI) tract, vasculature for biopsies) during clinical use.   5.7 Any simulated test soil(s) or formulations can be used for simulated use testing but shall be scientifically justified by the medical device manufacturer. Scope  1.1 This guide describes methods for selecting test soils for cleaning validations based upon the characteristics of the soil, the physical characteristics of the device, and the clinical use of the device.   1.2 This guide describes the preparation and use of some test soils for the validation of cleaning instructions for reusable medical devices.   1.3 Reusable medical devices such as endoscopes, arthroscopic shavers, surgical instruments, and suction tubes are exposed to biological soils during clinical use. Preparation of these devices for reuse requires cleaning and disinfection and/or sterilization as applicable. Adequate cleaning is the first step in a process intended to prevent contaminant transfer to the next patient and medical practitioner. The soils, if inadequately removed, can interfere with disinfection and sterilization processes, as well as performance of the device. Acceptance criteria are based either on a visual assessment or quantitatively specified marker(s) endpoint(s) of the soil or both (ISO/TS 15883-5, Section 1). Endpoints after cleaning should be based upon possible interference with disinfection/sterilization, risk to the patient or health care worker from the contaminant during further handling, and endpoints for cleaning established in the scientific literature.   1.4 The test soils are designed to simulate the contaminants that medical devices are likely to come in contact with during clinical use. The test soils discussed in this guide are a mixture of constituents that simulate what is commonly found in human secretions, blood, tissue, and bone fragments/shavings as well as non-patient derived soil (e.g., bone cement, lubricants, and dyes) during clinical procedures. The test soils also simulate the physical parameters (e.g., viscosity, adhesion) of clinical material to which the medical devices will be exposed.   1.5  Exclusion:   1.5.1 This guide does not include methods to validate cleaning processes to remove residues from manufacturing   1.5.2 This guide does not describe the soil/inoculum used for validation of disinfection or sterilization instructions. Disinfection or sterilization validation requires separate testing that is independent of cleaning validation studies.   1.5.3 Test soils described are not intended for use by health care facilities to verify the effectiveness of their cleaning process.   1.5.4 The test soil recipes are not intended to encompass every biological residue with which a medical device is likely to come into contact.   1.6 Test soil formulations not described in this guide may be clinically relevant and may be more appropriate for simulated-use testing depending upon the clinical use of the medical device. The burden is upon the medical device manufacturer to determine and justify scientifically the selection of test soil(s).   1.7 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.8  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2213-17,Standard Test Method for Measurement of Magnetically Induced Torque on Medical Devices  in the Magnetic Resonance Environment,"Significance and Use   5.1 This test method is one of those required to determine if the presence of a medical device may cause injury in the magnetic resonance environment. Other safety issues which should be addressed include but may not be limited to magnetically induced force (see Test Method F2052 ), RF heating (see Test Method F2182 ), and image artifact (see Test Method F2119 ). ISO TS 10974 addresses hazards produced by active implantable medical devices in the MR Environment.   5.2 The terms MR Conditional, MR Safe, and MR Unsafe together with the corresponding icons in Practice F2503 shall be used to mark the device for safety in the MR environment.   5.3 The acceptance criterion associated with this test shall be justified. If the maximum magnetically induced torque is less than the product of the longest dimension of the medical device and its weight, then the magnetically induced torque is less than the worst case torque on the device due to gravity. For this condition, it is assumed that any risk imposed by the application of the magnetically induced torque is no greater than any risk imposed by normal daily activity in the Earth's gravitational field. This is conservative. It is possible that greater torques also would not pose a hazard. (For example, device position with respect to adjacent tissue, tissue ingrowth, or other mechanisms may act to prevent device movement or forces produced by a magnetically induced torque that are greater than the torque due to gravity from causing harm to adjacent tissue.)   5.4 This test method alone is not sufficient for determining if an implant is safe in the MR environment.   5.5 The magnetically induced torque considered in this standard is the magneto-static torque due to the interaction of the MRI static magnetic field with the magnetization in the implant. The dynamic torque due to interaction of the static field with eddy currents induced in a rotating device is not addressed in this test method. Currents in lead wires may induce a torque as well. Scope   1.1 This test method covers the measurement of the magnetically induced torque produced by the static magnetic field in the magnetic resonance environment on medical devices and the comparison of that torque a user-specified acceptance criterion.   1.2 This test method does not address other possible safety issues which may include, but are not limited to, magnetically induced deflection force, tissue heating, device malfunction, imaging artifacts, acoustic noise, interaction among devices, and the functionality of the device and the MR system.   1.3 The torque considered here is the magneto-static torque due to the interaction of the MRI static magnetic field with the magnetization of the implant. The dynamic torque due to interaction of the static field with eddy currents induced in a rotating device is not addressed in this test method. Torque induced by currents in lead wires is not addressed by this standard.   1.4 The methods in this standard are applicable for MR systems with a horizontal magnetic field. Not all of the methods described in this standard are applicable for use in an MR system with a vertical magnetic field. The Suspension Method and the Low Friction Surface Method require gravity to be orthogonal to the magnetically induced torsion and may not be performed using a vertical magnetic field. The Torsional Spring and Pulley Methods can be adapted to work in a vertical magnetic field, however the example apparatus are not appropriate for use in a vertical magnetic field. The Calculation Based on Measured Displacement Force Method is independent of the MR system and thus could be used for an MR system with a vertical magnetic field.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E1766-15,Standard Test Method for  Determination of Effectiveness of Sterilization Processes for  Reusable Medical Devices (Withdrawn 2023),"Significance and Use  5.1 The test method is designed to demonstrate that all accessible surfaces and internal recesses or lumina of previously cleaned, reusable medical devices can be rendered free of recoverable microorganisms when processed in a specified sterilizer cycle.   5.2 Surviving spores are recovered by swabbing, brushing, or irrigating with an elution fluid. Recovery methods may be enhanced by mechanical action, sonication, and repeated flushing with elution fluid.  Note 1:  The spore inoculation technique described in this test method is only one of the available procedures for testing the sterilization of devices. Spores on paper strips (biological indocators) are a traditional tool used to develop and monitor sterilization cycles and are also appropriate for the evaluation of sterilization of medical devices. 5 Scope  1.1 This test method covers a reproducible procedure for testing processes used to sterilize reusable medical devices (instruments). This test method is not designed to validate a sterilization process, but tests an established sterilization cycle or process. It is a practical test of the effectiveness of a sterilization process applied to reusable medical devices. Bacterial spores more resistant to the test sterilant than the natural bioburden of the instrument are used as the test organisms. Commercially available liquid suspensions of bacterial spores are used to inoculate the instruments.   1.2 This test method is intended for reusable medical devices cleaned in accordance with the device manufacturer's instructions and prepared for sterilization in accordance with the instructions for the sterilization process being used.   1.3 This test method assumes that cleaned, reusable medical devices will be free of visible soil but may have remaining adherent bioburden. A worst-case bioburden can be represented by suspensions of bacterial endospores, which are commercially available for monitoring chemical or physical sterilization processes. These endospores should have a verifiable resistance (D value) to the specific process and sterilant being evaluated. 2   1.4 It is impractical to test for the sterility of some devices by immersion in growth medium because of their complexity, size, and availability (for long-term incubation) or adverse effects on the devices from long-term immersion. Therefore, elution, rinsing, or swabbing techniques are used to recover test organisms from inoculated devices.   1.5 A recovery control will be included by inoculation of a test device and use of the elution methods without applying the sterilization process being tested. A minimal recovery of 10 6 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL per device is required for the recovery control.   1.6 Results of the recovery control and process test cycle are compared to determine the effectiveness of the sterilization process.   1.7 Results of the recovery control and applied inoculum are compared to determine the recovery efficiency, if desired.   1.8 The procedure should reveal that tested devices are free of recoverable microorganisms when five or more consecutive tests are conducted.   1.9 A knowledge of microbiological techniques is required to conduct these procedures.   1.10 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.11  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

This guide is designed to detect neurotoxicity caused by medical devices that contact nervous tissue.   4.2 The testing recommendations should be considered for new materials, established materials with different manufacturing methods that could affect nervous tissue response, or materials used in new nervous tissue applications.   4.3 Chemical characterization can be used to evaluate similarity for materials with a history of clinical use in a similar nervous tissue application. Scope   1.1 Medical devices may cause adverse effects on the structure and/or function of the nervous system. In this guide, these adverse effects are defined as neurotoxicity. This guide provides background information and recommendations on methods for neurotoxicity testing. This guide should be used with Practice F748 , and may be helpful where neurotoxicity testing is needed to evaluate medical devices that contact central and/or peripheral nervous system tissue or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

,F619-20,Standard Practice for Extraction of Materials Used in Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 These extraction procedures are the initial part of several test procedures used in the biocompatibility screening of plastics or other materials used in medical devices.   5.2 The limitations of the results obtained from this practice should be recognized. The choices of the extraction vehicle, duration of immersion, and temperature of the test are necessarily arbitrary. The specification of these conditions provides a basis for standardization and serves as a guide to investigators wishing to compare the relative resistance of various plastics or other materials to extraction vehicles.   5.3 Correlation of test results with the actual performance or serviceability of materials is necessarily dependent upon the similarity between the testing and end-use conditions (see 12.1.2 and Note 7 ).   5.4 Caution should be exercised in the understanding and intent of this practice as follows:   5.4.1 No allowance or distinction is made for variables such as end-use application and duration of use. Decisions on selection of tests to be done should be made based on Practice F748 .   5.4.2 This practice was originally designed for use with nonporous, solid materials. Its application for other materials, such as those that are porous, absorptive (for example, sponge-like materials that are capable of absorbing liquid), or resorptive, should be considered with caution. Consideration should be given to altering the specified material-to-liquid ratio to allow additional liquid to fully hydrate the material and additional liquid or other methods to fully submerge the test specimen. Additional procedures that fully remove the extract liquid from the test specimen, such as pressure or physically squeezing the material, should also be considered as appropriate. Although no definitions are given in this practice for the following terms, such items as extraction vehicle surface tension at the specified extraction condition and test specimen physical structure should be taken into account.  Note 1:  While there are no standardized methods available at present for determining the solvent absorption capacity of an absorptive device or material, a suggested protocol is as follows: – Determine the volume of extraction vehicle that each 0.1 g or 1.0 cm 2 of device/material absorbs; – then, in performing the extraction, add this additional volume to each 0.1 g or 1.0 cm 2 in an extraction mixture.   5.5 Test Methods D570 and D1239 and Practices D543 may be useful in providing supplemental information. Scope  1.1 This practice covers methods of extraction of medical plastics and may be applicable to other materials. This practice identifies a method for obtaining “extract liquid” for use in determining the biological response in preclinical testing. Further testing of the “extract liquid” is specified in other ASTM standards. The extract may undergo chemical analysis as part of the preclinical evaluation of the biological response, and the material after extraction may also be examined.   1.2 This practice may be used for, but is not limited to, the following areas: partial evaluation of raw materials, auditing materials within the manufacturing process, and testing final products. This practice may also be used as a reference method for the measurement of extractables in plastics used in medical devices. In general, it is the responsibility of the user of the standard to determine if the methods described in this standard are appropriate for the materials in their device.   1.3 This practice was initially developed for extraction of medical plastics not intended to undergo degradation or absorption during normal medical device usage. When applied to the extraction of absorbable materials, additional considerations may be necessary in the selection of extraction procedures and fluids.   1.4 For assessment of compatibility of the Single-use System material with the cell culture medium or the manufacturing processes used for cell-based therapeutics, vaccines, cell-based diagnostics, or other biopharmaceutical products, the user should refer to Guide E3231 .   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E1837-96(2014),Standard Test Method to  Determine Efficacy of Disinfection Processes for Reusable Medical  Devices (Simulated Use Test) (Withdrawn 2023),"Significance and Use  5.1 This test method is designed to demonstrate and document that reusable devices and medical instruments can be disinfected using a specified technique.   5.2 This test method can be used to verify claims of disinfection of recesses, hinged sites, lumina, or other difficult-to-reprocess areas of reusable medical devices and instruments.   5.3 This test method also can be used to document the contribution of each element of the reprocessing cycle for reusable medical devices and instruments.   5.4 The number of surviving bacteria may be assessed using swabbing and irrigation or total immersion.   5.5 This test method may be used to produce quantitative or qualitative results. Scope  1.1 This test method is intended to describe a procedure for testing the effectiveness of a disinfection process for reprocessing reusable medical devices when it is tested with a challenge of vegetative cells including mycobacteria. Disinfection normally deals with testing activity against vegetative cells of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Since this test method is process oriented, the user may wish to examine a variety of test organisms.   1.2 This test method is designed to provide a reproducible procedure to verify the effectiveness of a previously validated disinfectant or disinfection procedure for reusable medical instruments and devices.   1.3 This test method is not meant to define the effectiveness of or validation of the particular disinfection process used or its kinetics, but rather, it is devised to confirm the effectiveness of the disinfection process by simulating use situations with a particular test process using medical devices and instruments. Either manual or machine reprocessing can be tested.   1.4 This test method is intended for use with reusable cleaned and previously sterilized or disinfected (high level) medical instruments and devices. Endoscopes are described in this test method as a worst-case example for contamination and sampling. The selected sterilization or disinfection processes, or both, should have been validated previously, as well as the effectiveness of rinsing for residual sterilant/disinfectant removal determined.   1.5 An inoculum with high numbers of selected microorganisms is applied to both test and control, cleaned and sterilized, or disinfected medical instruments. Strains of microorganisms with a recorded resistance to disinfectants are used to contaminate the instrument sites known or suspected to be the most difficult to reprocess.   1.6 It is impractical to test for recovery of survivors by immersion of some instruments, for example, endoscopes or some laproscopic instruments, in growth medium because of complexity, size, difficulty in long-term incubation, or deterious effects resulting from incubation. Elution of organisms from the inoculated surfaces, therefore, may be performed to estimate the number of recoverable organisms. Immersion can be used for smaller instruments.   1.7 Control instruments are inoculated in the same manner as the test instruments and elution or immersion methods are performed to determine the number of organisms recoverable from the instrument. For channeled devices, such as endoscopes testing, the number of organisms recoverable from the instrument (inside and outside) will serve as the initial control count. It is expected that some fraction of the number of organisms inoculated will be lost in the process of inoculation/drying.   1.8 A testing procedure can be performed on a complete reprocessing cycle or can be limited to just the cleaning or disinfection portions of the cycle whether reprocessing is done in a machine or manually.   1.9 After the test cycle has been completed, remaining inoculated bacteria will be recovered from test instruments using the same elution procedures as for the control instruments.   1.10 Efficacy of a disinfection cycle or reprocessing cycle, or any part thereof, may be determined by comparison of the number of microorganisms recovered from the control instrument (initial recoverable control count) to the recovery determined for the test instruments.   1.11 A knowledge of microbiological techniques is required to conduct these procedures. 3   1.12  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2475-20,Standard Guide for  Biocompatibility Evaluation of Medical Device Packaging Materials,"Significance and Use   5.1 The compatibility of packaging materials with a medical device is a requirement of many regulatory bodies. Since most medical devices are used or implanted in, around, or on the human body, the benefits of these devices must outweigh the risks. Therefore, the packaging materials that come in contact with the medical device must also be evaluated and determined to be safe for use with the human body in that they have no negative impact on the physical, chemical, or biological properties of the device. This evaluation may include both a study of relevant experience with, and actual testing of, packaging materials. Such an evaluation may result in the conclusion that no testing is needed if the material has a demonstrable history of safe use in the specific role that is the same as that of the package under design.   5.2 The medical device manufacturer determines the need for appropriate testing, with consideration of the device/package interactions, if any. When screening information is needed regarding the biocompatibility of the packaging, cytotoxicity testing from the supplier is typically performed.

Cytocompatibility considers the impact of the delivery device on the cells passing through the device during the delivery procedure. The biological safety of the device (e.g., the device’s cytotoxicity) should be addressed via other methods, such as ISO 10993-5. It is understood that this guide does not address testing of specific cellular products with specific delivery devices. Such testing may be required by regulatory authorities prior to clinical trial of cellular product or marketing applications. This guide outlines considerations to make the product qualification procedures more likely to succeed and more cost effective.   4.2 The key aspects of assessing device cytocompatibility include selecting a test cell line or cell lines and determining the cell physiology parameters that will be measured to make a determination of cytocompatibility. Acceptance criteria for designating a device as cytocompatible are not detailed here. It will be up to the delivery device end user to determine if the results of a cytocompatibility assessment are sufficient to consider that device cytocompatible. Delivery device lot to lot variability may impact cytocompatibility, therefore validated manufacturing processes should be considered when producing devices for cytocompatibility assessments. Scope  1.1 This guide outlines the parameters to consider when designing in vitro tests to assess the potential impact of a delivery device on a cellular product being dispensed. This guide does not provide specific protocols, but rather suggests what should be considered the minimum characterization necessary to assess device cytocompatibility. Topics discussed include selecting an appropriate cell line(s), cell physiology parameters to measure, and relevant test procedure variables.

Existing biocompatibility screening methods may not be fully predictive of the human response, and testing approaches such as those described here are needed for continuous improvement of the predictability of biocompatibility testing. The effectiveness of animal testing in terms of its predictability of human outcomes is dependent on the study design. If possible, study endpoints should be chosen to minimize interspecies variability and to investigate clinically relevant biological responses. While testing approaches should remain at the user’s discretion, the following should be taken into consideration when selecting most appropriate tests and study endpoints.   5.2.1 Device-induced responses usually involve both innate and adaptive immunities, which raises possible need for specific testing for each of these immune response types.  5.2.1.1 Device-related adaptive immune responses are mostly due to lymphocyte-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity. In vivo allergenicity to a test material (which can be introduced via different routes) should be assessed by monitoring for any signs of allergic and acute toxicity reactions, for example, scratch, tremor, and dyspnea. In addition, ex vivo analysis on immunophenotyping of the isolated splenocytes/lymphocytes from the same studies should be considered.  5.2.1.2 Device-related innate immune responses are mostly mediated by macrophages and can be assessed by histopathological assessment of the extent of FBR including macrophage accumulation around the test material. Supplementary ex vivo / in vitro assessment can be used for additional macrophage-based testing such as macrophage immunophenotyping (proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory/wound healing M2) as well as debris uptake by phagocytes (phagocytozability) involving the entire range of test material characteristics.   5.2.2 Due to the role of inflammation in extending device-related FBR and promoting the resultant tissue remodeling, histopathological assessment should include identification of immune/inflammatory cell infiltration (with separate counts for the individual cell types representing both innate and adaptive responses) as well as corresponding tissue changes (for example, fibrosis, necrosis, ossification or osteolysis, angiogenesis). Identification of immune/inflammatory cells may involve different approaches including IHC phenotyping as needed. Supplementary ex vivo / in vitro assessment should be considered for assessing the balance in release of pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as generation of hyper-proliferative versus hypo-proliferative tissue responses.  5.2.2.1 Since the signs of inflammation and post-inflammatory tissue changes may not be always apparent, special attention should be given to the assessment of debris-related inflammogenic and tissue remodeling potentials using ex vivo specimens and supplementary in vitro assessment when needed. Pro-inflammatory cell death (necrosis) should be distinguished from programmed cell death (apoptosis usually associated with anti-inflammatory responses) by using cell viability and cytotoxicity testing involving cellular staining and flow cytometry. Given the importance of phagocytes in proper clearance of dying cells, normal non-phlogistic phagocytosis of cells undergoing apoptosis should be distinguished from “frustrated” phlogistic phagocytosis which may result in further cell/tissue damage due to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). See X1.10 for more details.   5.2.3 Due to the role of the device-tissue interface in shaping biological responses, in vivo models as well as supplementary testing should be aimed to simulate (as much as possible) device-specific use environments. In vivo animal models with intra-articular applications of a test material may be beneficial for testing of orthopedic materials, while intracardiac/intravenous applications may be more beneficial for testing of cardio/endovascular materials.  5.2.3.1 Since many implantable materials come in contact with blood during their clinical use, the need for hemocompatibility testing should be considered, especially when developing new materials. Development of new materials for cardiovascular applications may benefit from a more detailed hemocompatibility assessment, which could include microcirculation, cell adhesion, and leukocyte-endothelial interactions.   5.2.4 The predictability of testing for a certain material, including its debris, may benefit from the choice of study endpoints and testing approaches that incorporates clinical experience from known therapeutic applications and safety issues of similar materials.  5.2.4.1 In general, the study endpoints should be selected per their ability to measure immunomodulatory, pro/anti-inflammogenic, and tissue remodeling effects. As the examples of more specific choices, testing for an orthopedic material should take into consideration potential tissue changes such as periprosthetic osteolysis and pseudotumors, while testing for a cardiovascular material should take into consideration potential hemolytic, thrombolytic/thrombogenic, and pro-angiogenic effects.  5.2.4.2 Some endpoints currently used in effectiveness assessments can be applied to the safety assessment of adverse tissue remodeling (examples of osteogenesis-related study endpoints can be found in X1.12 ).  5.2.4.3 While not all possible clinical complications can be accurately replicated in animal testing models, the properly selected study endpoints for in vivo and supplementary in vitro testing can enhance the overall predictability of biocompatibility testing (more details on the choice of measurable study endpoints are provided in X1.5 ).   5.2.5 Rodents and other small animals (for example, rabbit, guinea pig) are traditionally used for in vivo biocompatibility testing models. Use of larger animal models is usually limited due to ethical and other concerns and may be reserved for models in higher need for imitating similarities with humans (weight, bone and joint structure, etc.).   5.3  Abbreviations Used:   5.3.1  ALVAL— Aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion.   5.3.2  CD— Cluster differentiation.   5.3.3  DAMP— Damage-associated molecular pattern.   5.3.4  EDS/EDAX— Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.   5.3.5  ELISA— Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.   5.3.6  FBGC— Foreign body giant cell.   5.3.7  FBR— Foreign body response.   5.3.8  FTIR— Fourier-transform infrared (spectroscopy).   5.3.9  H&E— Hematoxylin and eosin.   5.3.10  HMGB1— High-mobility group box 1.   5.3.11  HSP— Heat shock protein.   5.3.12  ICAM1— Intercellular adhesion molecule-1.   5.3.13  ICP-MS— Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry.   5.3.14  Ig— Immunoglobulin.   5.3.15  IL— Interleukin.   5.3.16  LAL— Limulus amebocyte lysate.   5.3.17  LPS— Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin).   5.3.18  MMP— Matrix metalloproteinase.   5.3.19  NO— Nitric oxide.   5.3.20  NOS/iNOS— Nitric oxide synthase / Inducible nitic oxide synthase.   5.3.21  PCR— Polymerase chain reaction.   5.3.22  ROS— Reactive oxygen species.   5.3.23  SAA— Serum amyloid A.   5.3.24  SEM— Scanning electron microscopy.   5.3.25  α-SMA— Alpha-smooth muscle actin.   5.3.26  TBARS— Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.   5.3.27  TGF-β— Transforming growth factor-beta.   5.3.28  TLR— Toll-like receptor.   5.3.29  TNF-α— Tumor necrosis factor-alpha.   5.3.30  TRAP— Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.   5.3.31  VEGF— Vascular endothelial growth factor. Scope  1.1 The purpose of this standard guide is to describe the principles and approaches to testing of medical device debris and degradation products from device materials (for example, particles from wear) for their potential to activate a cascade of biological responses at local and systemic levels in the body. In order to ascertain the role of device debris and degradation products in stimulating such responses, the nature of the responses and the consequences of the responses should be evaluated. This is an emerging area. The continuously updated information gained from the testing results and related published literature is necessary to improve the study designs, as well as predictive value and interpretation of the test results regarding debris/degradation product related responses. Some of the procedures listed here may, on further testing, not prove to be predictive of clinical responses to device-related debris and degradation products. However, only the continuing use of standard protocols will establish the most useful testing approaches with reliable study endpoints and measurement techniques. Since there are many possible and established ways of determining the debris/degradation product related responses in vivo , a single standard protocol is not stated. However, this recommended guide indicates which testing approaches are most applicable per expected biological responses and which necessary information should be supplied with the test results. To address the general role of chronic inflammation in exaggerating device-related foreign body response (FBR), the recommendations in this standard include the assessment of device-related pro-inflammatory responses and subsequent tissue remodeling potential.   1.2 This document is to provide the users with updated scientific knowledge that may help better characterize medical device debris related responses. It is to help the users to optimize their plans for particle characterization and biocompatibility assessment by considering the testing principles and methods available in published literature that are appropriate to their products.   1.3 This standard is not sufficient to address device-related degradation products that result in gas formation or that are exclusively represented by nanoparticles, or soluble species such as dissolved metal ions.   1.4 While devices should be designed and manufactured in such a way as to reduce as far as possible the risks posed by substances or particles (including wear debris, degradation products, and processing residues) that may be released from the device, this standard guide may help users to identify the presence of wear debris and degradation products and subsequent adverse reactions that may occur.   1.5 Although this guide is based on the available device debris-related knowledge that is largely based on orthopedic devices, most of the recommendations are also applicable to other (non-orthopedic) device areas.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.7  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F3487-20,Standard Guide for Assessing the Service Life of a Brush Part Intended to Clean  a Medical Device,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide describes the use of test methods in Guides F3275 and F3276 to assess the service life of a brush part intended to clean a medical device.   5.2 In the case of a brush part intended to clean a lumen, the force required to move a brush part within a tube, an indicator of the friction a brush exerts on a surface, is a measurable parameter that can change over time and will decrease as the brush part loses integrity.   5.3 In the case of a brush part intended to clean the external surface, the force required to move the brush across a surface and the pressure the brush exerts on that surface are measurable parameters that can change over time and will decrease as the brush part loses integrity.   5.4 By providing objective, repeatable methods for evaluating performance under test conditions, this guide can improve the ability to assess the effectiveness of various brush part designs. Scope  1.1 This guide describes methods for assessing the service life, under prescribed laboratory conditions, of a brush part designed to clean a medical device. The method utilizes force testers to mechanically actuate a brush part at a constant rate. This action continues until the brush part demonstrates a significant reduction in cleaning power as measured by the force exerted during testing.   1.2 The test methods utilized in this guide are those described in Guides F3275 and F3276 . In this guide, the number of repetitions is open-ended and determined by the measurable fatigue of the brush part as measured by a reduction in force, as well as any observation of wear or damage to the brush part.   1.3 Brushes designed to clean medical devices after clinical use play an important role in the effective reprocessing of those medical devices. Instructions for use from the brush manufacturer should supply information related to the service life of the brush. This may be stated in terms of ( 1 ) a time period; ( 2 ) the number of uses; ( 3 ) inspection of the brush for wear and damage.   1.4 Inspection for wear should always be a part of the instructions for use of a brush. Application of this guide can help to determine like mode(s) of observable failure of a brush part.   1.5  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

Scope  1.1 Brushes used to clean a medical device after clinical use play an important role in effective reprocessing. This guide describes methods for characterizing, under prescribed laboratory conditions, the efficacy of brush parts designed to clean the internal channels of medical devices. The methods utilize a force tester to mechanically actuate a brush part within a channel: ( 1 ) Methods to measure, at an established speed, the force required to move a brush within a channel; ( 2 ) Methods utilize the same force tester and protocols to measure soil removal from a soiled tube, another indicator of performance.   1.2  Inclusions:   1.2.1 This guide describes objective, quantifiable, and reproducible methods for evaluating the cleaning characteristics of a brush part under prescribed laboratory conditions, with test methods that simulate the cleaning challenge of a defined target area(s) of a medical device. This also makes possible the comparison of one design of a brush part to another.   1.2.2 In this guide, a brush part is one that is intended to be moved within a tube.   1.2.3 Tubes used for testing described in this guide are cylindrical and uniform in diameter. The test methods describe may not apply to non-cylindrical tubes.   1.2.4 By use of this guide, medical device manufacturers can characterize the brush part designed for cleaning their device.   1.2.5 By use of this guide, manufacturers of cleaning brushes can evaluate and characterize the cleaning performance of their brushes for the target area(s) of medical device(s), including allowing a comparison with existing brush part designs offered on the market.

,F3276-22,Standard Guide for Using a Force Tester to Evaluate the Performance of a Brush  Part Designed to Clean the External Surface of a Medical Device,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide provides two test methods for evaluating the performance characteristics of a brush part designed to clean external surface(s) of a medical device by utilizing force testers.   5.1.1 The first test method utilizes a force tester to measure the force required to actuate a brush part across a surface. This is an indicator of the friction a brush exerts on a surface, a parameter of cleaning effectiveness.   5.1.2 The second test method measures the removal of soil from a surface by a brush part actuated across the surface. This is a further indicator of the effectiveness of a brush part to loosen and remove soil from a surface.   5.2 By providing objective, repeatable methods for evaluating performance under test conditions, this guide can improve the ability to assess the effectiveness of various brush part designs Scope  1.1 This guide describes methods for characterizing the efficacy, under prescribed laboratory conditions, of a brush part designed to clean the external surface of a medical device. The method utilizes force testers to mechanically actuate a brush part across a surface at a constant rate and constant pressure. In the first method, the force required to actuate across the surface is measured. In the next method, which utilizes the same force testers and protocol (actuation motion), the brush part is actuated on a soiled surface and the amount of soil removed is measured, as another indicator of performance.   1.2 Brushes designed to clean medical devices after clinical use play an important role in the effective reprocessing of those medical devices.   1.3  Inclusions:   1.3.1 This guide describes objective, quantifiable, and reproducible methods for evaluating the cleaning characteristics of a brush part, under prescribed laboratory conditions, with a test method that simulates the cleaning challenge of a defined target area(s) of a medical device. This also makes it possible to compare one brush part design to another.   1.3.2 By use of this guide, manufacturers of cleaning brushes will be able to evaluate and characterize the cleaning performance of their brushes for the target area(s) of medical device(s) and evaluate modifications to design and construction that might improve performance.   1.3.3 By use of this guide, this information can also be shared with the users of the brushes (medical device reprocessors) to help them evaluate the performance of commercially available brushes.   1.4  Exclusions:   1.4.1 This guide is not intended to be used for brushes designed to clean medical devices using rotational motion.   1.4.2 This guide does not assess potential damage that may be inflicted by the brush, or degradation of the brush that may occur during repeated use. Brushes with rigid bristles (for example, stainless steel or other metals) are predicted to be more likely to damage medical devices than brushes with flexible bristles (for example, nylon); damage from rigid-bristled brushes should be assessed. Assessing repeated use would require a greatly increased number of test repetitions than what is described in this guide.   1.4.3 This guide does not specify acceptance criteria, and the results will be dependent on the specific parameters that are tested (for example, test soil, drying time, surface area, and materials, etc.) that are tested.   1.4.4 This guide is not intended to constitute all steps required to conduct validation of cleaning instructions for a medical device, including use of brushes for this purpose, but provides methods that may be part of a broader protocol to conduct a complete cleaning instructions validation.

Physical characteristics (that is, form, density, hardness, surface finish) can influence the type and severity of the tissue response to the test materials.   4.2 This practice is intended as a short-term screening procedure for determining the acceptability of candidate materials. It may be utilized prior to using the long-term tests described in Practice F981 . It is recommended that for some applications, additional tests, including long-term implantation studies, may be required to assess the final suitability of the candidate materials.   4.3 This practice may not be appropriate for all types of implant applications. The user is cautioned to consider the appropriateness of the method in view of the materials being tested, their potential applications, and the recommendations contained in Practice F748 .

,F3044-20,Standard Test Method for Evaluating the Potential for Galvanic Corrosion for Medical  Implants,"Significance and Use  3.1 Implantable medical devices can be made of dissimilar metals or come into electrical contact with dissimilar metals leading to the potential for galvanic corrosion, which may result in the release of corrosion products with harmful biological consequences or a compromise of structural integrity of the device. Therefore, it is important to determine the susceptibility of these types of devices to galvanic corrosion.   3.2 Use of this test method is intended to provide information on the possible galvanic component of corrosion of two dissimilar metals in contact with one another. The dissimilar metals in contact may be on the same implantable medical device or as component parts of individual medical implant devices.   3.3 This test method has been designed to accommodate a wide variety of device shapes and sizes encountered by allowing the use of a variety of holding devices.   3.4 This standard is presented as a test method for conducting galvanic corrosion tests in a simulated physiological environment. Adherence to this test method should aid in avoiding some of the inherent difficulties in such testing. Other standards such as Guide G71 are general and, while they provide valuable background information, do not provide the necessary details or specificity for testing medical device implants. Scope  1.1 This test method covers conducting galvanic corrosion tests to characterize the behavior of two dissimilar metals in electrical contact that are to be used in the human body as medical implants or as component parts to medical implants. Examples of the types of devices that might be assessed include overlapping stents of different alloys, stent and stent marker combinations, orthopedic plates and screws where one or more of the screws are of a different alloy than the rest of the device, and multi-part constructs where two or more alloys are used for the various component parts. Devices which are to be partially implanted, but in long-term contact within the body (such as external fixation devices) may also be evaluated using this method.   1.2 This test method covers the selection of specimens, specimen preparation, test environment, method of exposure, and method for evaluating the results to characterize the behavior of galvanic couples in an electrolyte.   1.3 Devices and device components are intended to be tested in their finished condition, as would be implanted (that is, the metallurgical and surface condition of the sample should be in or as close as possible to the same condition as in the finished device).   1.4 This test method does not address other types of corrosion and degradation damage that may occur in a device such as fretting, crevices, or the effect of any galvanically induced potentials on stress corrosion and corrosion fatigue. Surface modifications, such as from scratches (possibly introduced during implantation) or effects of welding (during manufacture), are also not addressed. These mechanisms are outside of the scope of this test method.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  Warning— Mercury has been designated by many regulatory agencies as a hazardous substance that can cause serious medical issues.

,F1556-94(2015),Standard Guide for  Spinal Immobilization and Extrication (SPINE) Device Characteristics  (Withdrawn 2024),"Significance and Use  4.1 The intent of this guide is to identify characteristics that a SPINED shall possess.   4.2 As opposed to a full body spinal immobilization device, the SPINED incorporates additional features that assist in the extrication of a victim from a confined space.   4.3 It is not expected that the SPINED will be used alone to provide the entire scope of required immobilization. Clinical situations may require differing combinations of devices for adequate total spinal immobilization. A SPINE device may be one of the devices.   4.4 A device intended for use with adult patients shall accommodate the 95th percentile adult American male.   4.5 Devices that are labeled as intended for pediatric use shall not be required to accommodate adult patients.   4.6 The device shall be able to be used by the practitioner in an ergonomically sound manner. Scope  1.1 This guide covers minimum standards for devices, designated here as spinal immobilization and extrication device(s) (SPINED), commonly referred to as short spine board. The SPINED is designed to be used as the platform for immobilization and extrication of a patient with potential spine or spinal cord injury by emergency medical service personnel.   1.2 This guide does not identify specific degrees of limitation of motion achieved by placement of a SPINED on a patient. Definitive requirements for immobilization of the spine, and, in particular, the degree of limitation associated with the use of a SPINED, have not been established in the medical literature.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F997-18,Standard Specification for  Polycarbonate Resin for Medical Applications,"Scope  1.1 This specification covers polycarbonate resin and provides requirements and associated test methods for this thermoplastic when it is to be used in the manufacture of medical devices or components of medical devices.   1.2 As with any material, some characteristics may be altered by the processing techniques (such as molding, extrusion, machining, assembly, sterilization, and so forth) required for the production of a specific part or device. Therefore, properties of fabricated forms of this resin should be evaluated using those test methods that are appropriate to assure safety and efficacy.   1.3 The properties included in this specification are those applicable for polycarbonate only. The biocompatibility of plastic compounds made up of polycarbonate resin containing colorants, fillers, processing aids, or other additives, as well as polymer blends which contain polycarbonate, should not be assumed. The biocompatibility of these modified polycarbonates must be established by testing the final (end-use) compositions using the appropriate methods of evaluation. In addition, the biocompatibility of the material depends to a large degree on the nature of the end-use application. It is, therefore, necessary to specify a set of biocompatibility test methods for each new and distinct application.   1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.5  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F3260-18,Standard Test Method for Determining the Flexural Stiffness of Medical Textiles,"Significance and Use  5.1 Consideration of the flexural stiffness of medical textiles is important, as these devices often need to possess properties that allow them to conform readily to the anatomic structures they are designed to support or protect. This test method outlines the materials and methods for the determination of flexural properties along the different textile directions (that is, machine and cross-machine) and for the effects of textile surface orientation (that is, face and back orientations).   5.2 This test method can be used for quality control purposes.   5.3 This test method can be used for non-absorbable, absorbable, and partially absorbable medical textiles including films and membranes. Testing should be performed on both dry and appropriately conditioned specimens. If the specimen is fabricated from a hydrolytically degradable absorbable material or contains an absorbable component, testing after hydrolytic conditioning at appropriate time intervals should be undertaken using Test Method F1635 . For partially absorbable textiles, testing should be performed through at least two time intervals that exceed the point where the absorbable component no longer contributes to the specimen’s measurable mechanical properties.   5.4 If flexural rigidity values are found to show effects related to planar and surface orientation, results from this test method could potentially help in determining if devices should be implanted or used only at specific textile directions and surface orientations. Considerations for determining device planar and surface orientations for use would include, but are not limited to, primary direction of bending once implanted or during use, anatomic structures that will interact with the device, and physiologic loads (normal, pathological, and worst-case) the device would experience during use.   5.5 No evidence has been found showing that bending length is dependent on the width. However, the tendency for specimens to curl or twist can affect the result through the rigidity provided at the edge. Consequently, use of test specimens with greater width can help to reduce this edge effect.   5.6 This test method differs from Test Method D1388 in that it requires tracking of sample surface orientation and includes absorbable and partially absorbable medical textiles. Medical textiles with stiffness higher than is measureable using this cantilever bending method should consider evaluation using the cantilever beam method described in Test Method D747 . Scope  1.1 This test method covers the measurement of flexural stiffness properties of medical textiles (for example, surgical mesh, films, and membranes). Bending length is measured and flexural rigidity is calculated.   1.2 This test method may be used for absorbable or non-absorbable medical textiles.   1.3 This test method measures the flexural stiffness at room temperature in air and, if used directly, may not provide an accurate measure of in-vivo behavior for implantable medical textiles.   1.4 This test method is not suitable for testing tubular samples.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. Values in parentheses are for information only.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F3160-21,Standard Guide for Metallurgical Characterization of Absorbable Metallic Materials  for Medical Implants,"Significance and Use  5.1 The metallurgical properties of materials used to manufacture absorbable metallic implants can influence biological reactions and mechanical interaction with soft and hard tissue in the body. This standard guide describes a suggested material characterization scheme for absorbable metallic materials to ensure reproducibility of properties prior to their manufacture into medical implants. Scope  1.1 This guidance document provides metallurgical characterization information that may be beneficial in the evaluation of absorbable metallic materials intended for medical implant applications. This guide is primarily intended for absorbable metallic materials that undergo further processing into a fabricated final device. Therefore, this standard does not require assessments that are more appropriately conducted on the final device, such as biological evaluation. However, a few relevant standards for finished implant devices are included for information purposes.   1.2 The purpose of this guide is to identify appropriate test methods and relevant medical product standards that can be used to develop future standards for new or modified absorbable metallic materials.   1.3 This guide is not intended to cover other major classes of absorbable materials such as polymers, ceramics, composites, and tissue-engineered materials.   1.4 This standard guide is focused on the chemical, physical, microstructural, and mechanical properties plus inspection guidelines for metallic materials that are used for medical implants designed to be absorbed in the body over a period of time. This guide focuses on material characterizations and does not address device specific mechanical testing that may be necessary to determine safety and functionality of the implant.   1.5 Compliance with materials specifications developed in accordance with this standard may not necessarily result in a material suitable for its intended purpose. Additional testing specific to the intended use may be required.   1.6 Since surface modifications of medical implants are generally applied in the latter stages of manufacturing, this standard guide does not cover the characterization of either absorbable or non-absorbable surface coatings that are metallic in origin such as oxides or from the addition of other materials such as ceramics or polymers. However, this standard does apply to absorbable metallic materials, regardless of the presence or absence of a coating.   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.8  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F3357-19,Standard Guide for Designing Reusable Medical Devices for Cleanability,"Significance and Use   4.1 Reusable medical devices have a range of cleanability. The equipment, effort, and time expended for cleaning devices should be feasible in the intended setting. For that reason, it is essential that cleanability be considered during the design phase.   4.2 The next section highlights features that either have a tendency to retain debris and/or make removing contamination difficult. Individually, the criteria listed in this document may not render a device difficult to clean. Furthermore, it is the manufacturer’s responsibility to consider feasibility and ease of cleaning the device in the clinical environment when designing their device. Although it may not be feasible to remove or modify all of the problematic design features from a device, device manufacturers should be aware of challenging designs for cleaning and take appropriate action for minimizing the impact of these features on cleaning. For example, disassembly may be necessary to thoroughly clean a device, or it may be determined that a device cannot be adequately cleaned, in which case that device would be designated single-use only. In addition, manufacturers should consider the compatibility of their device design with subsequent sterilization or disinfection. Scope   1.1 This guide is intended to provide manufacturers of reusable medical devices design feature guidance to minimize debris retention after use and increase ease of removal of contaminants and cleaning product residuals from devices during cleaning/rinsing and also prepare for subsequent processing steps (for example, sterilization or disinfection).   1.2  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F3211-17,Standard Guide for Fatigue-to-Fracture (FtF) Methodology for Cardiovascular Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1  Use of this Methodology:   5.1.1 This guide provides a compendium of information on methods to use fracture data, fatigue life models, and statistical techniques to estimate the structural fatigue durability of an implantable medical device under anticipated in vivo loading modes. The methodology for high-cycle fatigue assessment relies on hyper-physiological tests intended to cause device fractures. Using the FtF methodology, fractures should not be avoided during testing; instead they provide the information required to statistically assess device longevity under a wide variety of physiological and hyper-physiological test conditions.   5.1.2 Through evaluation of fracture locations, the geometries after fractures, and the use conditions of the device, this guide may be used to help assess device safety.   5.1.3 This guide may be used to help assess differences in fatigue life between different devices or device histories. The effects on fatigue life due to changes to a device’s geometry, processing, or material may be assessed using this guide.   5.1.4 Users of this guide must keep in mind that bench tests are simulations of in-use conditions. Adherence to this guide may not guarantee that results translate to individual clinical scenarios. Therefore, in assessing a device’s fatigue performance, the results from Fatigue to Fracture testing should be reviewed in combination with other available data, such as animal studies, clinical experience, and computational simulations.   5.2  Significance of this Methodology:   5.2.1 While the FtF methodology applies only to bench tests, it can provide insights into device behavior that would not necessarily be apparent in clinical studies that typically focus on patient outcomes. After appropriate boundary conditions such as loadings, fixturing, and materials have been determined, the FtF methodology can provide extensive information on the expected longevity of a device in a period 10 to 1000 times shorter than a real-time clinical study.   5.2.2 FtF is informative in characterizing device behavior over a wide range of loads and cycles. This is especially valuable when the in vivo loading mode is understood but the load magnitude and cycle requirements are not well known or when characterizing device performance over a wide range of patient lifetimes, activity levels, and physiological states is desired.   5.2.3 In FtF, test loads greater than the devices’ expected use conditions are used. Thus, factors of safety can be measured relative to expected in vivo use conditions in both loading/deformation severity and number of cycles.   5.2.4 In FtF, the nature and location of fractures observed as a function of load can help provide insights into the device response to the applied loading. The identified primary and follow-on fracture locations and modes may be used to assess the credibility of device computational models, as well as to evaluate potential impacts on clinical safety and efficacy, especially post-fracture.   5.2.5 The FtF methodology can quickly and reliably assess the impact of changes in processes, materials, or small changes in geometry on in vitro fatigue life. These assessments with respect to fracture can be quantified and used as part of validating design changes, demonstrating that the device meets product specifications, or as part of guiding design improvements.   5.2.6 FtF testing can often be completed in a shorter period of time than test-to-success testing since the FtF tests are typically terminated at a smaller number of cycles. Specifically, when extrapolation in cycles is appropriate, comparisons of the loads or the frequency of fracture at a lower number of cycles can provide a useful measure of equivalence. Scope  1.1 This guide is intended to provide an experimental methodology to assess and determine the structural fatigue life of implantable cardiovascular medical devices.   1.2 This guide is also intended to provide methodologies to determine statistical bounds on fatigue life at in vivo use conditions using measured fatigue life derived in whole or in part from hyper-physiological testing to fracture.   1.3 This guide may be used to assess or characterize device durability during design development and for testing to device product specifications.   1.4 Fretting, wear, creep-fatigue, and absorbable materials are outside the scope of this guide, though elements of this guide may be applicable.   1.5 As a guide, this document provides direction but does not recommend a specific course of action. It is intended to increase the awareness of information and approaches. This guide is not a test method. This guide does not establish a standard practice to follow in all cases.   1.6 This guide is meant as a complement to other regulatory and device-specific guidance documents or standards and it does not supersede the recommendations or requirements of such documents.   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,D8179-18(2024),Standard Guide for Characterizing Detergents for the Cleaning of Clinically-used  Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 A critical step in preparing a medical device for safe use on the next patient is effective cleaning. Typically cleaning a medical device includes precleaning at the point-of-use, manual and automated methods for removing soil that accumulate during clinical use. The cleaning solution(s) used are almost always water for rinsing and water with a detergent during washing. AAMI TIR34 (also EN 285) provides guidance about the quality of water to be used during reprocessing. This guidance references various test methods to ensure that water meets the recommended quality.   5.2 When it comes to detergents very little guidance can be found in AAMI, ISO, ASTM, and FDA documents. Further, there are very few consensus methods for evaluating the detergents intended to clean medical devices. The result is that very little detail about detergents, for comparison purposes, is known. As a result, device manufacturers, when authoring their instructions for use (IFU) describe in very generic terms the kind of detergent that can be used to clean their device. Similarly, regulators, also have very little to rely upon for clearing reprocessing instructions. Finally, the healthcare facility, that is ultimately responsible for getting the device clean, has very little detail to assure that one brand of detergent is roughly equivalent to the one used by the medical device manufacturer during validation testing.   5.3 While consensus standard test methods do not exist for detergents intended to clean medical devices, there are dozens of such test methods when it comes to detergents intended to clean dishes, laundry, floors, countertops, and so forth. Many of these methods are under the domain of ASTM D12: Soaps and other Cleaning Agents Including Detergents. While differences certainly do exist, essentially the detergents used for the other purposes are roughly formulated in the same way. Using existing test methods can drive detergent formulation development or determine the need for new test methods for medical device cleaning, where or if needed. Scope  1.1 Detergents play a critical role in the cleaning of clinically-used medical devices, but there are few consensus methods for describing the key characteristics of these detergents. This guide identifies consensus standards, ASTM and others, used to characterize detergents in other applications, which can also be used to characterize detergents used to clean clinically-used medical devices.   1.2 In identifying these test methods, manufacturers of detergents can reference this guide to characterize their detergents.   1.3 By identifying applicable test methods, gaps may be identified where development of new standardized test methods need to be developed to characterize detergents intended to clean medical devices.   1.4 By identifying applicable test methods that are used and results reported by detergent manufacturers, test results can be shared and may lead in the future to development of performance criteria for the key characteristics of detergent.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  Exclusions:   1.6.1 This guide is not intended for detergents formulated to remove residues as a result of the manufacturing process.   1.6.2 This guide does not provide information related to disinfection or disinfecting agents that might be part of a detergent formulation.   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F3127-22,Standard Guide for Validating Cleaning Processes Used During the Manufacture of  Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide describes an approach to validate a cleaning system for a medical device. It is based on the manufacturer’s accurate and comprehensive understanding of their internal manufacturing and cleaning processes.   5.2 This guide is not intended to provide a detailed plan or road map, but will provide considerations that can be used by the device manufacturer to develop a detailed plan for performing cleaning validation.   5.3 In cleaning validation, as with other types of validations, there are multiple ways to achieve a compliant, scientifically sound, and practical cleaning validation program.   5.4 There are several reference documents identified in Appendix X3 that describe cleaning validation approaches for non-medical devices (including cleaning for oxygen-enriched environments, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors). Any of these reference documents could provide guidance for a well-defined process for establishing a manufacturer’s minimum expectation of a specific cleaning validation program.   5.5 This guidance specifically targets cleaning validation for medical devices, in-process and at terminal cleaning so that the result is a consistently clean medical device that meets the performance expectations for that device. Scope  1.1 This guide provides considerations for validating cleaning processes for medical devices during initial fabrication and assembly prior to initial use. Validated cleaning processes are important for achieving consistency in function and consistency in biocompatibility. The considerations include but are not limited to: validation approach, equipment design, procedures and documentation, analytical methods, sampling, development of limits, and other issues.   1.2  Inclusions:   1.2.1 This guide describes the validation of critical cleaning processes for medical devices to reduce contaminants to acceptable levels prior to packaging.   1.3  Exclusions— The following items / medical devices / processes are excluded from the scope of this document:   1.3.1 Reusable medical devices.  1.3.1.1 Validation of cleaning operations for reusable medical devices is not within the scope of this standard guide. Although cleaning of reusable medical devices is beyond the scope of this guide, many of the principles outlined in this guide may be applicable to the validation of cleaning operations for reusable devices.   1.3.2 Cleaning of medical devices in health care facilities.  1.3.2.1 Validation of cleaning processes in patient/health care facilities is not within the scope of this standard guide.   1.4 This standard does not purport to be a replacement for biological safety testing.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F1980-21,Standard Guide for  Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems and Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  4.1 The loss of sterile barrier system integrity may occur as a result of physical properties of the materials and adhesive or cohesive bonds degrading over time or by subsequent dynamic events during shipping and handling, or both. Accelerated and real time aging verifies the time-related aspects of potential integrity loss only.   4.2 ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11607–1: 2019, sub-clause 6.1.3, states that “the packaging system shall provide physical protection in order to maintain integrity of the sterile barrier system.” Sub-clause 6.1.6 states that, “A terminally sterilized sterile barrier system with its protective packaging, if included, shall be designed to, maintain sterility through exposure to expected conditions and hazards during the specified processing, storage, handling, and distribution until that SBS is opened at the point of use or until the expiry date.” Sub-clause 8.3.1 states, “Stability testing shall demonstrate that the sterile barrier system maintains integrity over time.” Sub-clause 8.3.3 states, “Stability testing, using accelerated aging protocols, shall be regarded as sufficient evidence for claimed expiry dates until data from real-time aging studies are available.”   4.3 Real time aging programs provide the best data to ensure that sterile barrier system/medical device materials and sterile barrier system/medical device integrity do not degrade over time. However, due to market conditions in which products may become obsolete in a short time, and the desire to get new products to market in the shortest possible time, real time aging studies do not meet this objective. Accelerated aging studies can provide an alternative means of screening for possible aging-related failure mechanisms in the SBS or medical device. To ensure that accelerated aging studies represent real time effects, real time aging studies must be conducted in parallel to accelerated studies. Real time studies must be carried out to the claimed shelf life of the product and be performed to their completion.   4.4 Conservative accelerated aging factors (AAFs) must be used if little is known about the sterile barrier system material being evaluated. More aggressive AAFs may be used with documented evidence to show a correlation between real time and accelerated aging.   4.5 When conducting accelerated aging programs for establishing expiry dating claims, it must be recognized that the data obtained from the study is based on conditions that simulate the effects of aging on the materials. The resulting creation of an expiration date or shelf life is based on the use of a conservative estimate of the aging factor (that is, Q 10 ) and is tentative until the results of real time aging studies are completed on the sterile barrier system.  Note 1:  Determining AAFs are beyond the scope of this guide. 6 Scope  1.1 This guide provides information for developing accelerated aging protocols to model the possible effects of the passage of time on the sterile integrity of the sterile barrier system (SBS), as defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11607–1: 2019 and the physical properties of their component packaging materials. Guidance for developing accelerated aging protocols may also be used for medical devices and medical device materials.   1.2 Information obtained using this guide may be regarded as sufficient evidence for expiration date claims for medical devices and sterile barrier systems until data from real-time aging studies are available.   1.3 The accelerated aging guideline addresses sterile barrier systems as a whole with or without devices. The sterile barrier system material and device interaction compatibility that may be required for new product development or the resulting evaluation is not addressed in this guide.   1.4 Real-time aging protocols are not addressed in this guide; however, it is essential that real-time aging studies be performed to confirm the accelerated aging test results using the same methods of evaluation. Real-time aging (stability) is the requirement of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11607–1: 2019.   1.5 Methods used for sterile barrier system performance validation, which include, environmental challenge, distribution, handling, and shipping events, are used for package performance (event-related loss of integrity) testing and are beyond the scope of this guide.   1.6 This guide does not address environmental challenging that simulates extreme climactic conditions that may exist in the shipping and handling environment. Refer to Practice D4332 for standard conditions that may be used to challenge the sterile barrier system to realistic extremes in temperature and humidity conditions. See Terminology F17 for a definition of “environmental challenging.”   1.7 The data obtained from accelerated aging studies is not to be used as a manner of establishing label storage conditions for sterile barrier systems.   1.8 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F2052-21,Standard Test Method for Measurement of Magnetically Induced Displacement Force on Medical  Devices in the Magnetic Resonance Environment,"Significance and Use  5.1 This test method is one of those required to determine if the presence of a medical device may cause injury to individuals during an MR examination or in the MR environment. Other safety issues which should be addressed include, but may not be limited to: magnetically induced torque (see Test Method F2213 ) and radiofrequency (RF) heating (see Test Method F2182 ). The terms and icons in Practice F2503 should be used to mark the device for safety in the magnetic resonance environment.   5.2 If the maximum magnetically induced displacement force for the specified magnetic field conditions (see Appendix X3 ) is less than the force on the device due to gravity (its weight), it is assumed that any risk imposed by the application of the magnetically induced force is no greater than any risk imposed by normal daily activity in the Earth’s gravitational field. This statement does not constitute an acceptance criterion; it is provided as a conservative reference point. It is possible that a greater magnetically induced displacement force can be acceptable and would not harm a patient or other individual in a specific case.  Note 2:  For instance, in the case of an implanted device that is or could be subjected to a magnetic displacement force greater than the force due to gravity, the location of the implant, surrounding tissue properties, and means of fixation within the body may be considered. For a non-implanted device with a magnetically induced force greater than the gravitational force, consideration should be given to mitigate the projectile risk which may include fixing or tethering the device or excluding it from the MR environment so that it does not become a projectile.   5.3 The maximum static magnetic field strength and spatial field gradient vary for different MR systems. Appendix X3 provides guidance for calculating the allowable static magnetic field strength and spatial field gradient.   5.4 This test method alone is not sufficient for determining if a device is safe in the MR environment. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the measurement of the magnetically induced displacement force produced by static magnetic field gradients (spatial field gradient) on medical devices and the comparison of that force to the weight of the medical device.   1.2 This test method does not address other possible safety issues which include, but are not limited to: issues of magnetically induced torque, radiofrequency (RF) heating, induced heating, acoustic noise, interaction among devices, and the functionality of the device and the magnetic resonance (MR) system.   1.3 This test method is intended for devices that can be suspended from a string. Devices which cannot be suspended from a string are not covered by this test method. The weight of the string from which the device is suspended during the test must be less than 1 % of the weight of the tested device.   1.4 This test method shall be carried out in a horizontal bore MR system with a static magnetic field oriented horizontally and parallel to the MR system bore.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F3335-20,Standard Guide for  Assessing the Removal of Additive Manufacturing Residues in  Medical Devices Fabricated by Powder Bed Fusion,"Significance and Use   5.1 Materials used in medical devices are selected in part for their biocompatibility, meaning that they have been demonstrated to have an acceptable biological response for the intended application. During manufacturing, most devices are exposed to a variety of processing steps and materials that have the potential to adversely affect the inherent biocompatibility of the device if they are not adequately removed prior to use.  Note 1:  For a fine powder, depending upon application, a new biological risk assessment may be required.   5.2 In additive manufacturing, components are in most cases built layer-by-layer, allowing unprecedented freedom to design complex devices. This makes it possible to build devices that are very difficult to clean, such as topological optimized parts, small internal channels, lattice structures, and especially reticulated porous structures for bone ingrowth and fixation.   5.3 Powdered fusion AM presents additional challenges. Components come out of the build volume with residual powder filling all open spaces within the device. The majority of the excess powder is typically removed by a combination of vibratory shaking, blowing with compressed gas, vacuuming, and ultrasonic cleaning in a solvent. However, the particles are typically very small and can become lodged in internal features such as pores, making removal difficult. Furthermore, particles that were immediately adjacent to the component during manufacturing can be partially sintered to the surface. Those particles can be extremely difficult to remove, are indistinguishable from loose particles when observed by most techniques, and may be at risk of detaching during the intended use of the device.   5.4 This guide provides specific evaluation techniques for measuring the effectiveness of residue removal processes, as they should be able to yield consistent results that meet the respective performance and cleanliness criteria for the intended use. Scope   1.1 This standard provides guidance for assessing the manufacturing material residues in medical devices fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, specifically, from powder bed fusion AM technologies.   1.1.1 Some of the techniques discussed in this guide may be applicable to devices fabricated by other types of AM equipment (e.g., stereolithography). Given each AM technique’s characteristics and post-processing challenges, there could be additional risks or considerations associated with some AM techniques or materials that are not addressed by this guide.   1.2 This guide covers several qualitative and quantitative assessments of the presence and amount of residue remaining in or obtained by extraction in aqueous or organic solvents from powder bed fusion AM medical components.   1.2.1 This guide identifies techniques to qualitatively determine the presence of residue and a technique to quantitatively assess it. It does not set acceptance criteria or acceptable limits for residues remaining in built parts. These methods are not the only methods to determine the presence or quantity of residual material in additive manufactured medical components.   1.3 This guide pertains to devices in their finished state (after post-processing and subsequent manufacturing processes), as applicable. This guide may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning processes between critical steps in the manufacturing process, to ensure minimal AM residue remains for cleaning processes downstream.   1.4 This guide is not intended to evaluate the residue level in medical components that have been cleaned for reuse.   1.5 Different cleaning methods, including high energy processes, can potentially damage small structures in AM parts. This guide does not address measurement or mitigation of this risk.   1.6 This guide does not address the manufacturing occupational health issues of working with small particles (e.g., breathing hazards).   1.7 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

For testing of final finished medical devices, the test article for implantation shall be as for intended use, including packaging and sterilization. The tissue responses to the test article are compared to the skeletal muscle and/or bone tissue response(s) elicited by control materials. The controls consistently demonstrate known cellular reaction and wound healing.

,F3604-23,Standard Practice for Validating the Additive Manufacturing (AM) Production Process  for Medical Devices Produced Using Laser Powder Bed Fusion,"Significance and Use  4.1  Overview:   4.1.1 Assurance of product quality is derived from careful attention to many factors but is not limited to raw material acceptance, software workflow definition, product and process design and control, printing and post processing, equipment and systems installation, maintenance, and in-process and end-product testing.   4.1.2 By managing these factors, a manufacturer can establish confidence that all finished manufactured units from successive lots will be acceptable and meet lot release criteria.   4.1.3 The basic principles of quality assurance (QA) have as their goal the production of articles that are fit for their intended use. These principles may be stated as:  4.1.3.1 Quality, safety, and effectiveness shall be designed and built into the product as well as the production process.  4.1.3.2 AM product characteristics all cannot currently be verified after the process without destructive testing and therefore requires validation. Suitable consideration should be designed into the product and controls should be applied to the process during process validation.  4.1.3.3 Critical steps of the production process impacting quality shall be controlled to maximize the probability that the finished product meets all quality and design specifications.   4.1.4 Process validation is a key element in ensuring that these QA goals are met. Routine end-product testing alone is often not sufficient to assure product quality. Some end-product tests have limited sensitivity. In some cases, destructive testing would be required to show that the manufacturing process is adequate, and in other situations, end-product testing does not reveal all variations that may occur in the product that may have an impact on device performance. However, successfully validating a process may reduce the dependence on intensive in-process and finished product testing. Note that, in most cases, end-product testing plays a major role in supporting QA goals, that is, validation and end-product testing are not mutually exclusive.   4.1.5 Key process variables should be monitored and documented using statistical process control where applicable. Analysis of the data collected from monitoring should establish the potential variability of process parameters for individual production runs to ensure that a process is within acceptable control limits and the equipment can consistently produce the product within specification.   4.2  Preliminary Considerations:   4.2.1 A manufacturer should evaluate all factors that affect product quality through appropriate documented process characterization.   4.2.2 Risk management and an analysis file shall be created in line with ISO 14971. These factors may vary considerably among different products, manufacturing technologies, and facilities. No single approach to process validation will be appropriate and complete in all cases; however, the following quality steps should be undertaken.   4.2.3 All pertinent aspects of the production processes that have an impact on device design (product’s end use) should be considered during process validation. These aspects include, but are not necessarily limited to, performance, reliability, and stability. Performance limits and variation should be established for each characteristic acceptance criteria and expressed in readily measurable terms. Once a product specification is defined it is important that any changes to it be made in accordance with documented change control procedures and the device history file. Scope  1.1 This practice provides an overview of how to perform process validation for medical devices manufactured using PBF/LB/M. The topics that will be covered include machine qualifications, software used in the manufacturing process, the importance of design specification and verification on process validation, and raw materials.   1.2 This practice also provides recommendations for process characterization, risk management, additive manufacturing (AM) facility qualification, and process control as a prerequisite for qualification activity, including installation qualification/operational qualification/performance qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ).   1.3 The practice is primarily focused on non-device-specific AM system(s) validation.

,F3602-23,Standard Guide for Assessing the Compatibility of a Cleaning Brush Part with Different  Substrates Used in the Construction of Medical Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide describes the use of test methods in Guide F3276 to assess the compatibility of a brush part with the material substrates used in the construction of medical devices.   5.2 By providing objective, repeatable methods for evaluating performance under test conditions, this standard can improve the ability to assess the effectiveness of various brush part designs. Scope  1.1 This guide describes methods for assessing the compatibility, under prescribed laboratory conditions, of a cleaning brush part with substrate materials used in the construction of medical devices. The method utilizes a force tester to mechanically actuate a brush part at a constant rate. This action continues until there is any level of visible degradation, including but not limited to scratching or shaving of the substrate material.   1.2 The test methods utilized in this guide are those described in Guide F3276 . In this guide, the number of repetitions is determined by the demonstrable degradation, if any, of the substrate, up to a specified maximum number of repetitions.   1.3 Brushes designed to clean medical devices after clinical use play an important role in the effective reprocessing of those medical devices. Instructions for use from the brush manufacturer should supply information related to the compatibility, or more importantly, incompatibility with materials that make up the composition of a medical device. This may be stated in terms of being suitable for specific materials, not suitable for specific materials, or suitable for a limited number of uses for specific materials.   1.4 Selecting the correct brush for the medical device to be cleaned is always a key factor to achieve effective cleaning. One of the significant factors when selecting a brush is selecting one that will not cause damage to the medical device, including the material the medical device is constructed of. Assessing if a brush part could damage a medical device because of the material the device is made of is an important step in determining the appropriate (and inappropriate) use of a brush.   1.5  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard.

,F813-20,Standard Practice for  Direct Contact Cell Culture Evaluation of Materials for Medical  Devices,"Significance and Use  4.1 This practice is useful for assessing cytotoxic potential both when evaluating new materials or formulations for possible use in medical applications, and as part of a quality control program for established medical materials and medical devices.   4.2 This practice assumes that assessment of cytotoxicity potential provides one method for predicting the potential for cytotoxic or necrotic reactions to medical materials and devices during clinical applications to humans. In general, cell culture testing methods have shown good correlation with animal assays when only chemical toxicities are being considered.  Note 1:  The results obtained using this method may not predict in vivo behavior which can be influenced by multiple factors such as those arising from site of application or physical properties that may result from design and fabrication.   4.3 This cell culture test method is suitable for adoption in specifications and standards for materials for use in the construction of medical devices that are intended to have direct contact with tissue, tissue fluids, or blood. However, care should be taken when testing materials that are absorbable, include an eluting or degradable coating, are liquid or gelatinous in nature, are irregularly shaped solid materials, or have a high density or mass, to make sure that the method is applicable. If leachables from the test sample are capable of diffusing through the agar layer, agarose-based methods such as Test Method F895 may be considered as an alternate method, depending on sample characteristics, or in cases where investigators wish to further evaluate the cytotoxic response of cells underlying the test sample. Scope  1.1 This practice covers a reference method of direct contact cell culture testing which may be used in evaluating the cytotoxic potential of materials for use in the construction of medical materials and devices.   1.2 This practice may be used either directly to evaluate materials or as a reference against which other cytotoxicity test methods may be compared.   1.3 This is one of a series of reference test methods for the assessment of cytotoxic potential, employing different techniques.   1.4 Assessment of cytotoxicity is one of several tests employed in determining the biological response to a material, as recommended in Practice F748 .   1.5 The L-929 cell line was chosen because it has a significant history of use in assays of this type. This is not intended to imply that its use is preferred; only that the L-929 is a well characterized, readily available, established cell line that has demonstrated reproducible results in several laboratories.   1.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

Extractable residue includes aqueous and non-aqueous residue, as well as non-soluble residue.   5.2 This test method recommends the use of a sonication technique to extract residue from the medical component. Other techniques, such as solvent reflux extraction, could be used but have been shown to be less efficient in some tests, as discussed in X1.2 .   5.3 This test method is not applicable for evaluating the extractable residue for the reuse of a single-use component (SUD). Scope   1.1 This test method covers the quantitative assessment of the amount of residue obtained from metallic medical components when extracted with aqueous or organic solvents.   1.2 This test method does not advocate an acceptable level of cleanliness. It identifies two techniques to quantify extractable residue on metallic medical components. In addition, it is recognized that this test method may not be the only method to determine and quantify extractables.   1.3 Although these methods may give the investigator a means to compare the relative levels of component cleanliness, it is recognized that some forms of component residue may not be accounted for by these methods.   1.4 The applicability of these general gravimetric methods have been demonstrated by many literature reports; however, the specific suitability for applications to all-metal medical components will be validated by an Interlaboratory Study (ILS) conducted according to Practice E691 .   1.5 This test method is not intended to evaluate the residue level in medical components that have been cleaned for reuse.

,F3306-19,Standard Test Method for Ion Release Evaluation of Medical Implants,"Significance and Use   5.1 Components of implanted medical devices can release ions, which may lead to adverse biological effects if released in sufficient quantities. Therefore, it may be necessary to characterize the ion release behavior over time to verify that a medical device or device components, or both, will not pose an unacceptable risk to patients. Some examples of when time-dependent ion release testing should be considered include:   5.1.1 New materials,   5.1.2 New applications (for example, different in-vivo environments or new designs) that may degrade corrosion resistance,   5.1.3 Manufacturing processes that may lead to increased ion release susceptibility,   5.1.4 Results of other corrosion testing (for example, Test Methods F2129 and F3044 ) indicate high susceptibility to corrosion.   5.2 Forming and finishing steps used to create an implantable device may have significant effects on the ion release behavior of the material from which the device is fabricated. Preconditioning can impact the ion release behavior of implants; therefore, prior to testing, devices should be subjected to preconditioning that is appropriate to their application. A justification shall be provided if preconditioning is omitted. Additional information on preconditioning is found in Appendix X1 . Substitute test articles (tubes, plates, wires, device subcomponents, etc.) may be used for testing with adequate justification, if all processing steps, including sterilization and preconditioning, are comparable to the finished device.   5.3 To accommodate the wide variety of device shapes and sizes likely to be encountered, various sizes and shapes of containers manufactured from various materials can be used. The container material choice should be justified.   5.4 Note that the test conditions described in this test method may not completely simulate those encountered in vivo (cells, proteins, mechanical loading, and other specifics of the in-vivo environment); however, the results of this testing conducted in simulated physiological solutions can provide useful data to estimate exposure as part of a risk assessment (for example, as per ISO 10993-17) or to compare different device materials, designs, or manufacturing processes. Scope   1.1 This test method assesses metal or other ions released from single-use, metallic, implantable medical devices, or components thereof, by exposing the device to solutions simulating the in-vivo environment and temperature in a container for a predetermined time frame with regular sampling at adequate intervals. Examples of device types that may be evaluated by this test method include, but are not limited to: cardiovascular devices, endovascular devices, and orthopedic implants. Devices which are to be partially implanted, but in long-term contact within the body (such as external fixation devices) may also be evaluated using this method.   1.2 This test method is used to assess devices or device components, or both, in their final form and finish, as they would be implanted. For modular implants, consideration should be given to individual testing of every part.   1.3 This test method covers the selection of specimens, specimen preparation, test environment, method of exposure, and method for evaluating the results to characterize ion release. Because of the variety of configurations and sizes of implants, a variety of specimen container configurations may be used.   1.4 This test method is not intended for ions only adsorbed onto the surface of the samples.   1.5 This test method does not apply to absorbable metallic implants (for example, magnesium-based stents, bone screws, etc.) that are intentionally designed to degrade in-vivo.   1.6 This test method does not cover the required subsequent chemical analysis, for example, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), or the validation of the analytical instrumentation.   1.7 This test method does not cover the influence of dynamic loading and associated surface damage or wear on ion release. Ion release may change under dynamic loading conditions and wear. Additional testing may be required, depending on the application and outcome of this test method.   1.8  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F2819-24,"Standard Test Methods for  Measurement of Straightness of Bar, Rod, Tubing, and Wire to  be Used for Medical Devices","Significance and Use  5.1  Significance— With the birth of minimally invasive surgery in the 1960s, there has been a requirement for guide wires. The guide wires serve as the access line by which procedures like balloon angioplasty and stent placement are conducted. A guide wire typically consists of a mandrel, coil, and in some cases a safety wire is used. The market for guide wires continues to grow as the number of procedures increases. For successful manufacturing of guide wires, linearity or straightness of 304 stainless steel and nitinol wire that is used for the manufacture of guide wire mandrels is critical to their end use performance. Users of guide wires require that they must navigate a tortuous anatomy.   5.1.1 A second part of minimally invasive surgery is the use of machined or formed wire, tube, or rod. In this case, straightness of rod, tube, and wire that is going to be machined or subjected to a forming practice such as bending needs to be very linear or straight so it is accurately fed into the equipment that is used for the machining or forming practice. Laser machining is an example of a machining operation that requires a wobble-free piece of rod, tubing, or wire so that it can be properly fed into the alignment bushings of the laser. Wire forming equipment also requires wobble-free material for the same reason.   5.2  Use— These test methods can be used by users and producers of medical grade bar, rod, tubing, and wire to specify requirements to evaluate and confirm the straightness of material. Depending upon the type of material and its metallurgical condition, it may be possible to reprocess the material to reduce its non-linearity. Scope  1.1 This standard covers the various test methods to be used for measurement of straightness of bar, rod, tubing, and wire. These test methods apply primarily to bar, rod, tubing, and wire that are ordered in the straightened and cut-to-length condition. They also apply to small diameter tubing and wire that has been specially processed to roll off a spool in the straightened condition.   1.2 These test methods apply to straightness of round wire that has a diameter between 0.05 and 4.78 mm (0.002 and 0.188 in.). They also apply to flatness (camber) of flat-shaped wire or ribbon with a maximum dimension between 0.05 and 4.78 mm (0.002 and 0.188 in.). For flatness (camber) measurement, refer to Test Method F2754/F2754M .  Note 1:  The current version of Test Method F2754/F2754M covers a different diameter range (0.0127 to 4.78 mm (0.0005 to 0.188 in.)) and does not include superelastic NiTi. These exceptions would not affect the camber measurement as conducted by Test Method F2754/F2754M .   1.3 These test methods apply to straightness of round tubing that has an outer diameter between 0.05 and 6.35 mm (0.002 and 0.25 in.).   1.4 These test methods apply to straightness of round rod that has a diameter between 4.78 and 6.35 mm (0.188 and 0.25 in.). It also applies to flatness (camber) of flat and shaped rod with a maximum dimension between 4.78 and 6.35 mm (0.188 and 0.25 in.).

,PS127-00,Standard Test Method for Evaluating the Ignition Sensitivity and Fault Tolerance of Oxygen Regulators Used for Medical and Emergency Applications (Withdrawn 2003),"Scope 1.1 This standard describes a test method for evaluating the ignition sensitivity and fault tolerance of oxygen regulators used for medical and emergency applications. 1.2 For the purpose of this standard, a pressure regulator is a device, also called a pressure-reducing valve, that is intended for medical or emergency purposes and that is used to convert a medical or emergency gas pressure from a high, variable pressure to a lower, more constant working pressure [21 CFR 868.2700 (a)]. 1.3 This standard applies only to oxygen regulators used for medical and emergency applications that are designed and fitted with CGA 870 pin-index adapters and CGA 540 inlet connections (CGA V-1). Note 1--Although this standard applies only to oxygen regulators used for medical or emergency applications, it may also apply to other types of oxygen regulators outside of this scope, at the discretion of the authority having jurisdiction. 1.4 This standard provides an evaluation tool for determining the fault tolerance of oxygen regulators used for medical and emergency applications. A fault tolerant regulator is defined as 1) having a low probability of ignition as evaluated by rapid pressurization testing and 2) having a low consequence of ignition as evaluated by forced ignition testing. 1.5 This standard is not a design standard; however, it can be used to aid designers in designing and evaluating the safe performance and fault tolerance capability of oxygen regulators used for medical and emergency applications (G 128). Note 2--It is essential that a risk assessment be carried out on breathing gas systems, especially concerning oxygen compatibility (refer to ASTM G 63 and G 94) and toxic product formation due to ignition or decomposition of nonmetallic materials as weighed against the risk of flammability (refer to ISO 15001.2). See Appendix X1 and Appendix X2.1 for details. 1.6 This standard is also used to aid those responsible for purchasing or using oxygen regulators used for medical and emergency applications in ensuring that selected regulators are tolerant of the ignition mechanisms that are normally active in oxygen systems. 1.7 This standard does not purport to address the ignition sensitivity and fault tolerance of an oxygen regulator caused by contamination during field maintenance. Regulator designers and manufacturers should provide design safeguards to minimize the potential for contamination or its consequences (G 88). 1.8 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

,F3515-21,Standard Guide for Characterization and Testing of Porcine Fibrinogen as a Starting  Material for Use in Biomedical and Tissue-Engineered Medical Product  Applications,"Significance and Use  5.1 The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance on characterization of the properties of porcine fibrinogen as a starting material for surgical implants and as a matrix for tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs). This guide contains a set of physical and chemical parameters directly related to the function of porcine fibrinogen. This guide can be used to help select and characterize appropriate fibrinogen starting materials for specific purposes. Not all tests or parameters are suitable for all uses of fibrinogen.   5.2 Fibrinogen described in this guide may be used in various types of medical products including, but not limited to, implants, tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs), and cell, drug, or DNA delivery vectors. The recommendations in this guide shall not be construed to guarantee the successful clinical application of any tissue-engineered medical product.   5.3 In determining whether fibrinogen meets the requirements for use in a TEMP, the relevant regulatory authorities or other appropriate guidelines relating to the production, regulation, and approval of TEMP products shall be taken into account (Guide E1298 , Practice F981 , Practice F1983 ). Scope  1.1 This guide covers the evaluation of porcine fibrinogen suitable for use in biomedical or pharmaceutical applications including, but not limited to, tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs).   1.2 This guide addresses key parameters relevant for functionality, characterization, and purity of porcine fibrinogen.   1.3 As with any material, some characteristics of porcine fibrinogen may be altered by processing techniques, such as electrospinning ( 1 ) 2 and sterilization, required for the production of a specific formulation or device. Therefore, properties of fabricated forms of this protein should be evaluated using test methods that are appropriate to ensure safety and efficacy and are not addressed in this guide.   1.4 The primary focus of this document is fibrinogen derived from porcine blood, which is similar to human fibrinogen. The biggest advantage that pigs have over other species (such as cattle, sheep, goats, elk, and deer) is that they are less likely to transmit transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE) (ISO 22442-1 Annex D; WHO Guidelines, 2003; WHO Guidelines, 2006; WHO Guidelines, 2010). The document may also discuss fibrinogen from other sources when useful information is available. Fibrin is also discussed in some sections.   1.5  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.7  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F748-16,Standard Practice for  Selecting Generic Biological Test Methods for Materials and  Devices,"Significance and Use  4.1 The objective of this practice is to recommend appropriate biological endpoint assessments (which may or may not require testing) to establish a reasonable level of confidence concerning the biological response to a material or device, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary testing.   4.2 This practice is intended to provide guidance to the materials investigator in selecting the proper procedures to be carried out for the screening of new or modified materials. Because each material and each implant situation involves its own unique circumstances, these recommendations should be modified as necessary and do not constitute the only assessment that will be required for a material. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as minimum requirements for any particular situation. While an attempt has been made to provide recommendation for different implant circumstances, some of the recommended assessment may not be necessary or reasonable for a specific material or application. Scope  1.1 This practice recommends generic biological test methods for materials and devices according to end-use applications. While chemical testing for extractable additives and residual monomers or residues from processing aids is necessary for most implant materials, such testing is not included as part of this practice. The reader is cautioned that the area of materials biocompatibility testing is a rapidly evolving field, and improved methods are evolving rapidly, so this practice is by necessity only a guideline. A thorough knowledge of current techniques and research is critical to a complete evaluation of new materials.   1.2 These test protocols are intended to apply to materials and medical devices for human application. Biological evaluation of materials and devices, and related subjects such as pyrogen testing, batch testing of production lots, and so on, are also discussed. Tests include those performed on materials, end products, and extracts. Rationale and comments on current state of the art are included for all test procedures described.   1.3 The biocompatibility of materials used in single or multicomponent medical devices for human use depends to a large degree on the particular nature of the end-use application. Biological reactions that are detrimental to the success of a material in one device application may have little or no bearing on the successful use of the material for a different application. It is, therefore, not possible to specify a set of biocompatibility test methods which will be necessary and sufficient to establish biocompatibility for all materials and applications.   1.4 The evaluation of tissue engineered medical products (TEMPs) may, in some cases, involve different or additional testing beyond those suggested for non-tissue-based materials and devices. Where appropriate, these differences are discussed in this practice and additional tests described.   1.5 The ethical use of research animals places the obligation on the individual investigator to determine the most efficient methods for performing the necessary testing without undue use of animals. Where adequate prior data exists to substantiate certain types of safety information, these guidelines should not be interpreted to mean that testing should be unnecessarily repeated.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

Clinical situations may require differing combinations of devices for adequate total spinal immobilization. An ACSID may be one of the devices.   4.3 An ACSID is intended to provide stabilization and/or support in addition to other immobilization devices in one or more of the planes of motion mentioned in 3.2.1 (see 4.2 ). Scope  1.1 This guide establishes minimum standards for devices designated here as adjunct cervical spine immobilization device (ACSID); a lateral stabilizer for the head is an example of this type of device. The ACSID is designed to be used to assist in the immobilization of the cervical spine, by emergency medical services personnel.   1.2 This guide does not identify specific degrees of limitation of motion achieved by placement of an ACSID on a patient. Definitive requirements for immobilization of the spine, and, in particular, the degree of limitation associated with the use of an ACSID, have not been established in the medical literature.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,G175-24,Standard Test Method for  Evaluating the Ignition Sensitivity and Fault Tolerance of  Oxygen Pressure Regulators Used for Medical and Emergency Applications,"Significance and Use  4.1 This test method comprises two phases and is used to evaluate the ignition sensitivity and fault tolerance of oxygen pressure regulators used for medical and emergency applications.   4.2  Phase 1: Oxygen Pressure Shock Test— The objective of this test phase is to determine whether the heat or temperature from oxygen pressure shocks will result in burnout or visible heat damage to the internal parts of the pressure regulator.   4.2.1 The criteria for a valid test are specified in the resistance to ignition tests in ISO 10524–1 for oxygen pressure regulators and ISO 10524–3 for oxygen VIPRs.   4.2.2 The pass/fail criteria for a pressure regulator are specified in the resistance to ignition tests in ISO 10524–1 for oxygen pressure regulators and ISO 10524–3 for oxygen VIPRs.   4.3  Phase 2: Promoted Ignition Test—   4.3.1  Oxygen Pressure Regulator— The objective of this test phase is to determine if an ignition event upstream of the pressure regulator inlet filter will result in sustained combustion and burnout of the pressure regulator.  4.3.1.1 The criterion for a valid test is either, ( 1 ) failure of the pressure regulator, as defined in 4.3.1.2 , or ( 2 ) if the pressure regulator does not fail, consumption of at least 90 % of the ignition pill as determined by visual inspection or mass determination.  4.3.1.2 Failure of the pressure regulator is defined as the breach of the pressurized regulator component (burnout), which may include the CGA 870 seal ring, and ejection of molten or burning metal or any parts, including the gauge, from the pressure regulator. See Appendix X6 Testing Pressure Regulators and VIPRs with Gauges. However, momentary (less than 1 s) ejection of flame through normal vent paths, with sparks that look similar to those from metal applied to a grinding wheel, is acceptable and does not constitute a failure.   4.3.2  Oxygen VIPR— The objective of this test is to determine if an ignition event upstream of the shut-off valve or within the shut-off valve will result in sustained combustion and burnout of the VIPR, while the VIPR is flowing oxygen in the patient-use direction.  4.3.2.1 The criterion for a valid test is either, (1) failure of the VIPR as defined in 4.3.2.2 , or (2) if the VIPR does not fail, consumption of at least 90 % of the ignition pill as determined by visual inspection or mass determination. Although the intent and desired result is to provide sufficient energy to ignite the shut-off valve seat, ignition of the shut-off valve seat is not required for a valid test. See Rationale in Appendix X7 .  4.3.2.2 Failure of the VIPR is defined as the breach of the pressurized VIPR component (burnout) and ejection of molten or burning metal or any parts, including the gauge, from the VIPR. See Appendix X6 Testing Pressure Regulators and VIPRs with Gauges. However, momentary (less than 1 s) ejection of flame through normal vent paths, with sparks that look similar to those from metal applied to a grinding wheel, is acceptable and does not constitute a failure.   4.3.3 There is no requirement that the oxygen pressure regulator or oxygen VIPR be functional after being subjected to the promoted ignition test.  Note 4:  The criterion for both the pressure regulator and VIPR Phase 2 tests does not include evaluation of external hardware (such as plastic guards and bags) that could be subjected to a momentary ejection of flame through normal vent paths. Scope  1.1 For the purpose of this test method, a pressure regulator, also called a pressure-reducing valve, is a device intended for medical or emergency purposes that is used to convert a medical or emergency gas pressure from a high, variable pressure to a lower, more constant working pressure [21 CFR 868.2700 (a)]. Some of these oxygen pressure regulators are a combination of a pressure regulator and cylinder valve. These devices are often referred to as valve integrated pressure regulators, or VIPRs.   1.2 This test method provides an evaluation tool for determining the ignition sensitivity and fault tolerance of oxygen pressure regulators and VIPRs used for medical and emergency applications. An ignition-sensitive pressure regulator or VIPR is defined as having a high probability of ignition as evaluated by rapid pressurization testing (Phase 1). A fault-tolerant pressure regulator or VIPR is defined as having a low consequence of ignition as evaluated by forced ignition testing (Phase 2).  Note 1:  It is essential that a risk assessment be carried out on breathing gas systems, especially concerning toxic product formation due to ignition or decomposition of nonmetallic materials as weighed against the risk of flammability (refer to Guide G63 and ISO 15001.2). See Appendix X1 and Appendix X2 for details.   1.3 This test method applies only to:   1.3.1 Oxygen pressure regulators used for medical and emergency applications that are designed and fitted with CGA 540 inlet connections, CGA 870 pin-index adapters (CGA V-1), or EN ISO 407 pin-index adapters.   1.3.2 Oxygen VIPRs used for medical and emergency applications that are designed to be permanently fitted to a medical gas cylinder.   1.4 This test method is a test standard not a design standard; This test standard is not intended as a substitute for traditional design requirements for oxygen cylinder valves, pressure regulators and VIPRs. A well-designed pressure regulator or VIPR should consider the practices and materials in standards such as Guides G63 , G88 , G94 , and G128 , Practice G93 , CGA E-18, CGA E-7, ISO 15001, ISO 10524-1 and ISO 10524-3 .  Note 2:  Medical applications include, but are not limited to, oxygen gas delivery in hospitals and home healthcare, and emergency applications including, but not limited to, oxygen gas delivery by emergency personnel.   1.5 This test method is also intended to aid those responsible for purchasing or using oxygen pressure regulators and VIPRs used for medical and emergency applications by ensuring that selected pressure regulators are tolerant of the ignition mechanisms that are normally active in oxygen systems.   1.6 This test method does not purport to address the ignition sensitivity and fault tolerance of an oxygen regulator or VIPR caused by contamination during field maintenance or use. Pressure regulator and VIPR designers and manufacturers should provide design safeguards to minimize the potential for contamination or its consequences (see Guide G88 ).  Note 3:  Experience has shown that the use of bi-direction flow filters in components can lead to accumulation and re-release of contaminants (refer to Guide G88 -05 7.5.3.8 and EIGA Info 21/08).   1.7 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded as standard.

,F2383-11,Standard Guide for Assessment of Adventitious Agents in Tissue Engineered Medical Products (TEMPs) (Withdrawn 2020),"Significance and Use TEMPs may be composed of biological products (for  example, human cells, organs, tissues, derivatives, and processed biologics),  biomaterials (for example, substrates and scaffolds composed of polymers or  collagen), and biomolecules (for example, recombinant proteins, alginates,  and hyaluronates) (see Terminology F2312 ). Those  TEMPs that contain human viable cells, organs, or tissues differ in terms  of adventitious agent safety from other TEMPs because of the need to preserve  viability of the organ, tissue, or cellular components. The need for preservation  of viability limits processing options for the reduction or elimination of  adventitious agents. Examples of TEMPs are listed in Classification F2211 .  To ensure production and use of TEMPs with minimal  risks associated with microorganisms and other adventitious agents, a multi-tiered  approach is required. Donor testing, as well as testing of components and  raw materials by sufficiently sensitive assays that are state of the art is  usually necessary. Compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and  good tissue practices (GTPs), where applicable, is required (21 CFR 210, 211, 820, 1270, and 1271). Although some of the components  of the TEMPs may be processed to remove potential microbiological contaminants,  viable tissues and cellular components are generally unable to withstand rigorous  processing without losing functionality. For those TEMPs containing tissues  or cells for which banking is not possible, even greater reliance on donor  screening, component testing, and manufacturing controls is required. When  more upfront testing is possible, there is generally greater confidence in  the safety of the final product. Process validation can enhance confidence  in the ability of the TEMPs' producer to minimize risks from adventitious  agents.  Throughout this guide, the reader is referred to  other documents that may provide specific information that can be applied  in the manufacture and testing of TEMPs. Although many of these documents  were not written with TEMPs in mind, parts are often applicable. Most of the  potentially applicable position papers and guidance documents from many regions  of the world can be accessed via the internet. New documents are continually  produced. The MDCA (U.K. Medical Devices Agency, now part of MHRA, Medicines  and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) Code of Practice for the Production  of Human-Derived Therapeutic Products provides information  on quality control, microbiological safety of donations, production, and processing  practices. Two Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) reports  provide valuable information. One of these reports addresses preclinical safety  assessment of TEMPs, and the other provides an approach to risk management  for TEMPs (1, 2) .  References may be made to draft guidances and rules.  These should not be read as requirements. Scope 1.1 This guide is intended as a resource for individuals  and organizations involved in the production, delivery, and regulation of  tissue engineered medical products (TEMPs). The safety from contamination  by potentially infectious adventitious agents is important in the development  of all TEMPs as well as their components. This guide addresses how to assess  safety risks associated with adventitious agents and their byproducts. These  agents currently include bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, viruses, endotoxins,  transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and parasitic organisms.

,F2129-24,Standard Test Method for Conducting Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization Measurements  to Determine the Corrosion Susceptibility of Small Implant Devices,"Significance and Use  5.1 Corrosion of implantable medical devices can have deleterious effects on the device performance or may result in the release of corrosion products with harmful biological consequences; therefore it is important to determine the general corrosion behavior as well as the susceptibility of the devices to localized corrosion.   5.2 The forming and finishing steps used to create an implantable device may have significant effects on the corrosion resistance of the material out of which the device is fabricated. During the selection process of a material for use as an implantable device, testing the corrosion resistance of the material is an essential step; however, it does not necessarily provide critical data regarding device performance.   5.3 To accommodate the wide variety of device shapes and sizes encountered, a variety of holding devices can be used.   5.4 Note that the method is intentionally designed to reach conditions that are sufficiently severe to cause breakdown and deterioration of the medical devices and that these conditions may not necessarily be encountered in vivo . The results of this corrosion test conducted in artificial physiological electrolytes can provide useful data for comparison of different device materials, designs, or manufacturing processes. However, note that this test method does not take into account the effects of cells, proteins, and so forth, on the corrosion behavior in vivo . Scope  1.1 This test method assesses the corrosion susceptibility of small metallic implant medical devices, or components thereof, using cyclic (forward and reverse) potentiodynamic polarization. Examples of device types that may be evaluated by this test method include, but are not limited to, vascular stents, ureteral stents (Specification F1828 ), filters, support segments of endovascular grafts, cardiac occluders, aneurysm or ligation clips, staples, and so forth.   1.2 This test method is used to assess a device in its final form and finish, as it would be implanted. These small devices should be tested in their entirety. The upper limit on device size is dictated by the electrical current delivery capability of the test apparatus (see Section 6 ). It is assumed that test methods such as Reference Test Method G5 and Test Method G61 have been used for material screening.   1.3 Because of the variety of configurations and sizes of implants, this test method provides a variety of specimen holder configurations.   1.4 This test method is intended for use on implantable devices made from metals with a relatively high resistance to corrosion.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.7  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E2314-03(2014),Standard Test Method for  Determination of Effectiveness of Cleaning Processes for Reusable  Medical Instruments Using a Microbiologic Method (Simulated Use Test) (Withdrawn 2021),"Significance and Use  5.1 This test method is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning reusable medical instruments using a specified cleaning process.   5.2 This test method may be used to determine the effectiveness of cleaning processes of recesses, hinged sites, lumina, or other difficult-to-reprocess areas of reusable medical instruments.   5.3 This test method may also be used to verify the claims for any portion of the cleaning cycle.   5.4 The recovery of surviving microorganisms may be accomplished using swabbing, rinsing, or total immersion of instruments.   5.5 The efficacy of the elution methods or loss of the applied inoculum may be assessed by recovery of target organisms from control instruments that have not been subjected to the cleaning process. Scope  1.1 This test method is written principally for large medical instruments or instruments with internal channels or recesses (for example, flexible endoscopes) but may be used for any resuable medical instruments.   1.2 This test method describes a procedure for testing the efficacy of a cleaning process for reusable medical instruments artificially contaminated with mixtures of microorganisms and simulated soil.   1.3 The test method utilizes bacterial spores as tracers for foreign materials and quantifies their removal as a means of determining the efficacy of a cleaning process.   1.4 The test method is designed for use by manufacturers of medical instruments and devices. However, it may also be employed by other individuals who have a knowledge of the instruments, techniques and access to appropriate facilities.   1.5 Worst-case conditions can be represented by exaggerating a specific test parameter or otherwise intentionally simulating an extreme condition such as performing the test without cleaning solutions or utilizing instruments which are not new.   1.6 The test procedure is devised to determine the efficacy of a cleaning process as applied to a particular instrument or group of instruments by simulating actual use situations.   1.7 The test procedure may be performed on test instruments using a complete cleaning cycle or be limited to particular phases of the cycle such as precleaning, manual cleaning, automated cleaning, or rinsing.   1.8 The test procedure is normally performed on a number of external and internal sites, but it may be restricted to one particular site on the instrument.   1.9 A knowledge of microbiological and aseptic techniques and familiarity with the instruments is required to conduct these procedures.  Note 1:  Because contamination of the surfaces of instruments may occur as a result of rinsing with tap water, bacteria-free water should be used for all rinsing when a water rinse step is part of the cleaning directions.  Note 2:  Test methods to determine the effectiveness of cleaning medical instruments has only recently been actively debated, and research efforts are in their infancy. Because published experimental results are scarce, it is premature to dictate experimental reagents, conditions or acceptance criteria.  Note 3:  The total elimination of the target organisms is not the goal of cleaning. Therefore, there will almost always be a number of microorganisms surviving on the test instruments unless one of the solutions or processes disinfects or sterilizes the test instrument. The results of various clinical and laboratory tests suggest that cleaning processes alone can produce a 10 2 to 10 4 log 10 reduction in bioburden. The exact reduction will depend upon the precise experimental conditions. The criteria for judging cleanliness should be determined and recorded before initiation of the test procedure.  Note 4:  This test protocol employs target spores as indicators or tracers for foreign materials and monitors their removal by the cleaning process. It is certainly possible that other particulate target materials, such as microbeads (latex beads) could be used in place of microbes. These alternate approaches would be more practical in those circumstances where microbiological expertise is limited.   1.10 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

Scope  1.1 This standard provides recommendations regarding the development of a simulated use model for particulate generation testing of endovascular devices.   1.2 Corresponding recommendations will be provided for the coronary, peripheral, and neurovascular anatomy respectively, as these different environments each have unique challenges and considerations that should be incorporated into the model development.   1.3 Considerations include, but are not limited to: anatomical considerations (for example, tortuosity, dimensions, disease state), working path length of the human vasculature, model/device interactions (for example, material properties, vessel straightening due to device placement), and device/device interactions (for example, use of delivery catheters and/or guide wires).   1.4 Standardizing the model development allows for better interpretation of the test results and comparison of performance of similar medical devices.   1.5 Explicit models for devices (or groups of devices) are not provided in this document as specific device attributes (for example, device flexibility, device material), anatomical target locations, and intended patient population can strongly impact model design. This document enables the development of a model that appropriately and sufficiently challenges the subject device with respect to particulate generation.   1.6 While this document is intended to aid in the development and design of the simulated use model for the assessment of particulate generation, additional information regarding the evaluation of the particulate matter and particulate measurements can be found in AAMI TIR 42.

,F2428-04(2011),Standard Guide for Selection and Use for Pelvic Ring Circumferential Compression Stabilization  Devices (PRCCSD) (Withdrawn 2020),"Significance and Use The intent of this guide is to identify the general  performance and good practice standards that a pelvic ring circumferential  compression stabilization device (PRCCSD) should possess.  Currently, a number of base platforms such as full-body  spinal immobilization devices (long boards) are used to immobilize patients  during transport and before definitive treatment. These platforms limit gross  movements of the spine and pelvis but do not specifically reduce and stabilize  disruptions of the pelvic ring. The PRCCSD applied circumferentially about  the patient exerts a compressive force to reduce and stabilize disruptions  of the pelvic ring.  The PRCCSD may be used alone but, according to clinical  situations, will commonly be used in conjunction with different supporting  base platforms during transport and before definitive treatment.  The PRCCSD, when circumferentially applied, should  be centered at the level of the greater trochanters and symphsis pubis.  A device intended for use with adult patients shall  accommodate the 95 th percentile adult American male.  The device should be able to be applied by a single  practitioner. Scope 1.1 This guide establishes minimum standards for devices designated here as pelvic ring circumferential compression stabilization devices(s)  (PRCCSD), commonly known as pelvic slings, belts, or binders. The PRCCSD is used as the initial pelvic ring stabilization device on patients suspected of having sustained traumatic disruptions of the pelvic ring. It is used during patient transport by emergency personnel and before definitive treatment.  1.2 This guide addresses the recognized need to reduce and stabilize pelvic ring disruptions through the use of circumferential compression devices.  1.3 Peer-reviewed medical literature does describe specific testing methods used to determine the range of effective compression force,  efficacy in reduction, stability, and safety for a particular (PRCCSD). This  guide, however, does not identify specific testing methods as it is recognized such methods could vary according to device configuration and study design.  1.4 This guide does not address individual quantitative  performance standards for any particular device, but does address general  performance standards and good practice characteristics for all devices using  circumferential compression to reduce and stabilize disruptions of the pelvic  ring.  1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of the  safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2567-06(2010),Standard Practice for Testing for Classical Pathway Complement Activation in Serum by Solid Materials (Withdrawn 2016),"Significance and Use  Inappropriate activation of complement by blood-contacting medical devices may have serious acute or chronic effects on the host. Solid medical device materials may activate complement directly by the alternative pathway, or indirectly because of antigen-bound antibodies (as with immuno-adsorption columns) by the classical pathway. This practice is useful as a simple, inexpensive, function-based screening method for determining complement activation by solid materials in vitro by the classical pathway.  This practice is composed of two parts. In part A (Section 11), HS is exposed to a solid material. If complement activation occurs by the classical pathway, C4 will be depleted. Activation by the alternative pathway will not deplete C4. In part B (Section 12), C4 activity remaining in the serum after exposure to the test material is assayed by diluting the serum below the concentration needed to lyse antibody-coated sheep RBC on its own, then adding the diluted HS to C4(-)GPS (which is itself at a dilution where all complement components are in excess save the missing C4). Lacking C4, the C4(-)GPS does not lyse the antibody-coated sheep RBC unless C4 is present in the added HS. The proportion of lysis remaining in the material-exposed HS sample versus the 37 ° C control HS sample (which was not exposed to the test material) indicates the amount of C4 present in the HS, loss of which correlates with classical pathway activation.  This function-based in vitro test method for classical pathway complement activation is suitable for adoption in specifications and standards for screening solid materials for use in the construction of medical devices intended to be implanted in the human body or placed in contact with human blood outside the body. It is designed to be used in conjunction with Practice F1984 for function-based whole complement activation screening, and Practice F2065 for function-based alternative pathway activation screening.  Assessment of in vitro classical complement activation as described here provides one method for predicting potential complement activation by solid medical device materials intended for clinical application in humans when the material contacts the blood. Other test methods for complement activation are available, such as immunoassays for specific complement components (including C4) and their split products in human serum (see X1.3 and X1.4).  If nonspecific binding of certain complement components, including C4, to the materials occurs in part A of this practice, a false positive for classical pathway activation will be observed in step B. Classical pathway complement activation by the test material may be confirmed by demonstrating an absence of C4 bound to the material following removal of the serum, and/or production of complement split-products such as C4d in the serum (as determined by immunoassay). Although immunoassay could be done in place of this screening procedure, determination of C4d production alone may not be functionally significant. This practice does not detect trivial amounts of classical activation unable to affect functional lysis of sensitized RBC. Scope  1.1 This practice provides a protocol for rapid, in vitro functional screening for classical pathway complement activating properties of solid materials used in the fabrication of medical devices that will contact blood.  1.2 This practice is intended to evaluate the acute in vitro classical pathway complement activating properties of solid materials intended for use in contact with blood. For this practice, “ serum ” is synonymous with “ complement. ”  1.3 This practice consists of two procedural parts. Procedure A describes exposure of solid materials to a standard lot of human serum [HS], using 0.1 mL serum per 13 × 100 mm disposable glass test tube. Procedure B describes assaying the exposed serum for significant functional classical pathway complement depletion (decrease in amount of C4) as compared to control serum samples not exposed to the material. The endpoint in Procedure B is lysis of sheep red blood cells (RBC) coated with antibody (hemolysin).  1.4 This practice does not address the use of plasma as a source of complement.  1.5 This practice is one of several developed for the assessment of the biocompatibility of materials. Practice F748 may provide guidance for the selection of appropriate methods for testing materials for other aspects of biocompatibility. Practice F1984 provides guidance for testing solid materials for whole complement activation in human serum, but does not discriminate between the classical or alternative pathway of activation. Practice F2065 provides guidance for testing solid materials for alternative pathway complement activation in serum.  1.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.  1.7 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2458-05(2024),Standard Test Method for  Wound Closure Strength of Tissue Adhesives and Sealants,"Significance and Use  4.1 Materials and devices that function at least in part by adhering to living tissues are finding increasing use in surgical procedures either as adjuncts to sutures and staples, or as frank replacements for those devices in a wide variety of medical procedures. While the nature and magnitude of the forces involved vary greatly with indication and with patient-specific circumstances, all uses involve to some extent the ability of the material to resist imposed mechanical forces. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the materials, and in particular the adhesive properties, are important parameters in evaluating their fitness for use. In addition, the mechanical properties of a given adhesive composition can provide a useful means of determining product consistency for quality control or as a means for determining the effects of various surface treatments on the substrate prior to use of the device.   4.2 The complexity and variety of individual applications for tissue adhesive devices, even within a single indicated use (surgical procedure, which itself may vary depending on physical site and clinical intention), is such that the results of a single tensile strength test is not suitable for determining allowable design stresses without thorough analysis and understanding of the application, adhesive behaviors, and clinical indications.   4.3 This test method may be used for comparing adhesives or bonding processes for susceptibility to fatigue, mode of failure, and environmental changes, but such comparisons must be made with great caution since different adhesives may respond differently to varying conditions.   4.4 A correlation of the test method results with actual adhesive performance in live human tissue has not been established. Scope  1.1 This test method covers a means for comparison of wound closure strength of tissue adhesives used to help secure the apposition of soft tissue. With the appropriate choice of substrate, it may also be used for purposes of quality control in the manufacture of medical devices used as tissue adhesives.   1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F1983-23,Standard Practice for  Assessment of Selected Tissue Effects of Absorbable Biomaterials  for Implant Applications,"Significance and Use  5.1 This practice is a guideline for a screening test of candidate materials or assessment of local tissue response to absorbable medical devices which are expected to undergo complete absorption within three years.   5.2 This practice is similar to those for studies on candidate materials or medical devices that are not absorbable, such as those specified in Practices F763 , F981 , and F1408 ; however, analysis of the host response must take into account the effect of degradation and degradation products on the inflammatory response at the local tissue site and on subsequent healing of the implantation site, as well as the potential for adverse distal tissue effects.   5.3 For testing of absorbable medical devices, the test article for implantation should be in the final finished form as for intended use, including packaging and sterilization (if applicable). Configurations specific to the animal study may be needed. The test article’s surface-area-to-body mass or mass-to-body mass ratios within the animal model should be established by calculating based on surface-area-to-body mass or mass-to-body mass ratios in humans during the device’s intended clinical use. Worst-case clinical dose should be considered in the study design. For implantation studies incorporating evaluation of both local tissue responses and systemic toxicity, exaggerated material surface area or mass-to-body mass ratios (for example, a 2X to 10X safety factor to assess implant safety for regulatory submissions) compared to clinical use (for example, largest device size, maximum number of devices) should be considered, unless otherwise justified. For example, implantation of exaggerated doses may not be feasible in the selected animal model. For some devices, additional animal group(s) for exaggerated conditions should be considered if dose response information is needed. Additionally, for some devices, exaggerated dose at a specific implantation site can also be used to evaluate local tissue responses.   5.4 Materials that are designed for use in devices with in situ polymerization shall be introduced in a manner such that in situ polymerization occurs. Additional testing of individual precursor components or partially polymerized materials may be needed in some cases (for example, if testing of the final implant indicates an adverse response or incomplete polymerization). Scope  1.1 This practice provides experimental protocols for biological assays of tissue reactions to absorbable biomaterials for implant applications. This practice applies only to absorbable materials with projected clinical applications in which the materials will reside in bone or soft tissue longer than 30 days and less than three years. Other standards with designated implantation times are available to address shorter time periods. Careful consideration should be given to the appropriateness of this practice for slowly degrading materials that will remain for longer than three years. It is anticipated that the tissue response to degrading biomaterials will be different from the response to nonabsorbable materials. In many cases, a chronic inflammatory response may be observed during the degradation phase, but the local histology should return to normal after absorption; therefore, the minimal tissue response usually equated with biocompatibility may require long implantations.   1.2 The time period for implant absorption can depend on variables of chemical composition, implant size, implant location, and animal models. Therefore, the selected time points for assessing tissue effects may be selected based on the rate of absorption.   1.3 These protocols assess the effects of the material on the animal tissue in which it is implanted. They do not fully assess systemic toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and development toxicity, or mutagenicity of the material. Other standards are available to address these issues.   1.4 To maximize use of the animals in the study protocol, some aspects of systemic toxicity, including effects of degradation products on different organs and tissues downstream of or surrounding the target site, can be addressed with this practice.   1.5 Because animal models are not identical to human biology, this practice cannot account for all potential biological hazards, for example the effect of the oligosaccharide a-Gal (Gala 1,3-Galb1-4GlcNAc-R), known as the “a-Gal” epitope present in xenogeneic materials on humans.

This guide is not intended to prescribe or limit the clinical uses of these products.   4.2 One objective of the current guide is to include the wide range of CTPs for which there is a rationale for benefit beyond that achievable with conventional wound coverings. Whether an individual CTP is capable of promoting wound healing must be determined by adequate evidence and is beyond the scope of this standard. Given that some of the materials used in dressings and skin substitutes (defined in Guide F2311 ) are the same as those used in CTPs, there has been confusion as to how to classify these products.   4.3 This guide is distinguished from Guide F2311 , which defines terminology and provides classification by clinical use for products that can be substituted for tissue grafts of human or animal tissue in medical and surgical therapies of skin lesions. In contrast, this guide defines terminology for description of CTPs for skin wounds; CTPs are defined primarily by their composition. Neither guide establishes a correspondence between device structure and clinical function. Scope  1.1 This guide defines terminology for description of cellular and/or tissue-based products (CTPs) for skin wounds. CTPs are TEMPs (tissue-engineered medical products) that are primarily defined by their composition and comprise viable and/or nonviable human or animal cells, viable and/or nonviable tissues, and may include extracellular matrix components. CTPs may additionally include synthetic components.   1.2 This guide also describes categories and terminology for CTPs based on their composition. This systematic categorization is not intended to be prescriptive for product labeling, and it describes only the most salient characteristics of these products; the actual biological and clinical functions can depend on characteristics not recognized in the categorization and it should be understood that two products that can be described identically by the categorization should not be presumed to be identical or have the same clinical utility.   1.3 This guide defines CTP-related terminology in the context of skin wounds. However, this guide does not provide a correspondence between the CTP composition and its clinical use(s). More than one product may be suitable for each clinical use, and one product may have more than one clinical use.   1.4 This guide does not purport to address safety concerns with the use of CTPs. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices involved in the development of said products in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance documents and in implementing this guide to evaluate the cellular and/or tissue-based products for wounds.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E3321-21,Standard Test Method for  Intraluminal Catheter Model used to Evaluate Antimicrobial Urinary Catheters for Prevention of <span>Escherichia coli</span> Biofilm Growth,"Significance and Use  5.1 In the battle to reduce medical device and implant-related infections, prevention of bacterial colonization of surfaces is a logical strategy. Bacterial colonization of a surface is a precursor to biofilm formation. Biofilm is the etiological agent of many implant and device-related infections and once established, microorganisms in biofilm can be up to 1000 times more tolerant to antibiotic therapy. Often the best treatment strategy is removal of the implant or device at a high socioeconomic cost. Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most prevalent of the device-related healthcare associated infections. Catheter associated infections account for 37 % of all hospital acquired infections (HAI) and 70 % of all nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) in the U.S. ( 2 , 3 ) . The Intraluminal Catheter Model (ICM) was developed to evaluate the ability of antimicrobial catheters to inhibit biofilm growth on the catheter lumen.   5.2 The purpose of this test method is to direct a user in how to grow, sample, and analyze an E. coli biofilm in a urinary catheter under a constant flow of artificial urine. The test method incorporates operational parameters utilized in similar published methods ( 4 ) . The E. coli biofilm that grows has a patchy appearance that varies across the catheter. Microscopically, the biofilm is heterogenous, with large clusters in some areas, and flat sheets of cells or even single cells in others. By 24 h, the biofilm is developed in the control catheters. If the goal is to monitor early stage biofilm development, then tubing and effluent samples need to be collected prior to the 24 h sample collection. Monitoring biofilm development requires sampling. The biofilm generated in the Intraluminal Catheter Model is suitable for comparison testing between antimicrobial and control catheters. Scope  1.1 This test method specifies the operational parameters required to assess the ability of antimicrobial urinary catheters to prevent or control biofilm growth. Efficacy is reported as the log reduction in viable bacteria when compared to a repeatable ( 1 ) 2  Escherichia coli biofilm grown in the intra-lumen of a urinary catheter under a constant flow of artificial urine.   1.2 The test method is versatile and may also be used for growing and/or characterizing biofilms and suspended bacteria of different species, although this will require changing the operational parameters to optimize the method based upon the growth requirements of the new organism.   1.3 This test method may be used to evaluate surface modified urinary catheters that contain no antimicrobial agent.   1.4 This test method describes how to sample and analyze catheter segments and effluent for viable cells. Biofilm population density is recorded as log colony forming units per surface area. Suspended bacterial population density is reported as log colony forming units per volume.   1.5 Basic microbiology training is required to perform this test method.   1.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2392-04(2015),Standard Test Method for  Burst Strength of Surgical Sealants,"Significance and Use  4.1 Materials and devices that function at least in part by adhering to living tissues are finding increasing use in surgical procedures, either as adjuncts to sutures and staples or as frank replacements for those devices in a wide variety of medical procedures. While the nature and magnitude of the forces involved varies greatly with indication and with patient specific circumstances, all uses involve, to some extent, the ability of the material to resist imposed mechanical forces. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the materials, and in particular the adhesive and cohesive properties, are important parameters in evaluating their fitness for use. In addition, the mechanical properties of a given sealant composition can provide a useful means of determining product consistency for quality control, or as a means for determining the effects of various surface treatments on the substrate prior to use of the device.   4.2 The complexity and variety of individual applications for sealant, even within a single indicated use (surgical procedure), is such that the results of a burst test are not suitable for determining allowable design stresses without thorough analysis and understanding of the application and sealant behaviors.   4.3 This test method may be used for comparing sealants for susceptibility to environmental changes, but such comparisons must be made with great caution since different sealants may respond differently to varying conditions.   4.4 As the true sealant strength is strongly dependent on the strength of the sealant/substrate interface, the selection of a proper test substrate is critical. Care must be taken when extrapolating in vitro test results to in vivo expectations. In vitro sealant optimization may not translate to expected in vivo performance due to differences in substrate surface, strength, and elasticity. Scope  1.1 This test method provides a means for comparison of the burst or rupture strength of sealants on soft tissue. This test method can be used as a clinically relevant model for quality assurance, development, and comparative testing of different adhesives or adherends.   1.2 This test method measures only burst strength or “cohesive strength” of an adhesive/adherend system, and not the adhesive strength.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

Scope  1.1 This practice uses quality risk management (QRM) and life-cycle approach to establish integrity assurance of single-use systems (SUSs), such as but not limited to bag assemblies and liquid transfer sets for processing, storage, and shipping of (bio)pharmaceutical products. It gives recommendations to identify failure modes and risks associated with such systems and their use-cases and how to identify the relevant leak(s) of concern. Integrity assurance in this context is limited to the barrier properties of the SUS, linked to microbial integrity and bioburden control (product quality) and liquid product loss (operator and environmental contamination). The required level of integrity assurance will depend on how critical the application is and can be interpreted in different ways. It can also vary between processes and applications used for different modalities (for example, advanced therapies). Other package barrier properties different from that, such as but not limited to gas barrier properties for gas headspace preservation, as well as porous barrier packages are not considered.

,F1608-21,Standard Test Method for  Microbial Ranking of Porous Packaging Materials (Exposure Chamber   Method),"Significance and Use  5.1 The exposure-chamber method is a quantitative procedure for determining the microbial-barrier properties of porous materials under the conditions specified by the test. Data obtained from this test is useful in assessing the relative potential of a particular porous material in contributing to the loss of sterility to the contents of the package versus another porous material. This test method is not intended to predict the performance of a given material in a specific sterile-packaging application. The maintenance of sterility in a particular packaging application will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:   5.1.1 The bacterial challenge (number and kinds of microorganisms) that the package will encounter in its distribution and use. This may be influenced by factors such as shipping methods, expected shelf life, geographic location, and storage conditions.   5.1.2 The package design, including factors such as adhesion between materials, the presence or absence of secondary and tertiary packaging, and the nature of the device within the package.   5.1.3 The rate and volume exchange of air that the porous package encounters during its distribution and shelf life. This can be influenced by factors including the free-air volume within the package and pressure changes occurring as a result of transportation, manipulation, weather, or mechanical influences (such as room door closures and HVAC systems).   5.1.4 The microstructure of a porous material which influences the relative ability to adsorb or entrap microorganisms, or both, under different air-flow conditions. Scope  1.1 This test method is used to determine the passage of airborne bacteria through porous materials intended for use in packaging sterile medical devices. This test method is designed to test materials under conditions that result in the detectable passage of bacterial spores through the test material.   1.1.1 A round-robin study was conducted with eleven laboratories participating. Each laboratory tested duplicate samples of six commercially available porous materials to determine the Log Reduction Value (LRV) (see calculation in Section 12 ). Materials tested under the standard conditions described in this test method returned average values that range from LRV 1.7 to 4.3.   1.1.2 Results of this round-robin study indicate that caution should be used when comparing test data and ranking materials, especially when a small number of sample replicates are used. In addition, further collaborative work (such as described in Practice E691 ) should be conducted before this test method would be considered adequate for purposes of setting performance standards.   1.2 This test method requires manipulation of microorganisms and should be performed only by trained personnel. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (CDC/NIH-HHS Publication No. 84-8395) should be consulted for guidance.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E3231-19,Standard Guide for Cell Culture Growth Assessment of Single-Use Material,"Significance and Use  5.1 A risk-based approach must be used to determine the cell lines, test articles, and materials used for testing. An evaluation of relevant factors should be made to determine if a test article is representative of the intended use.   5.2 Cell culture compatibility should be assessed if the material is in direct contact with cell culture medium regardless of duration of contact. Test articles can be of a single material or assembled from a multitude of materials.   5.3 Two perspectives to single-use material cell culture compatibility assessments are the supplier and the end user perspectives. It is understood that the supplier may have better access to single-use materials and material manufacturing processes, while having limited access to representative cell lines. Supplier assessment of materials are best tested using cell lines available that have shown known material sensitivity. The end users may have more limited access to materials but access to more representative cell lines and processes. Therefore assessment of compatibility of material with a specific cell line in a process is best evaluated by the end user.   5.4 This guide outlines best practices to establish test procedures. Appendix X1 outlines an example test procedure for a commercially available CHO cell line. Scope  1.1 This guide outlines best practices to consider when setting up a representative leachable test method to detect if a material is compatible with cell culture media or manufacturing processes. This guide does not replace or supersede cell growth tests like USP <87>, USP <88> (plastic/elastomeric materials), or ISO 10993 (medical device materials), that are used in assessing biological reactivity in humans. Polymeric materials that have passed these tests have been found to leach compounds under normal process conditions that can inhibit cell culture growth for some cell lines. See Refs ( 1- 5 ) . 2 Test methods that are representative of the manufacturing conditions will help identify materials that are appropriate for use during manufacturing.   1.2 This guide may be relevant to biopharmaceutical manufacturing, cell-based therapeutics, vaccines, cell-based diagnostics, and other areas.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F3300-23,Standard Test Method for  Abrasion Resistance of Flexible Packaging Films Using a Reciprocating  Weighted Stylus,"Significance and Use  5.1 Materials such as engineered thermoplastic films are often used for flexible barrier packaging. However, handling and transportation can cause abrasion to the packaging film and possibly compromise the integrity of the contents (for example, sterility of a medical device). This test method provides a comparative ranking of material performance that can be used as an indication of relative end-use performance.   5.2 The resistance of material surfaces to abrasion, as measured on a testing machine under laboratory conditions, is only one of several factors contributing to wear performance or durability as experienced in the actual use of the material. While abrasion resistance and durability are frequently related, the relationship varies with different end uses and different factors may be necessary in any calculation of predicted durability from specific abrasion data.   5.3 The resistance of material surfaces to abrasion may be affected by factors including test conditions of temperature and humidity, type of abradant, pressure between the specimen and abradant, mounting or tension of the specimen, and type, kind, or amount of finishing materials such as coatings or additives. Other causes of variation include local material movement during testing, material direction alignment, material characteristics, and mandrel and stylus wear. For consistency, samples to be evaluated under special environmental conditions shall be conditioned under those same conditions. It is important that the test instrument be shown to operate properly under special environmental conditions.   5.4 This test method may not be suitable for all films, including the following cases:   5.4.1 Films that stretch and generate a ripple in the abraded region during testing,   5.4.2 Films that have a thickness greater than 0.25 mm (0.010 in.), or are of such rigidity that forming over the mandrel would cause internal stresses that weaken the film, and   5.4.3 Conductive films. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of the abrasion resistance of flexible non-conductive films and packaging materials using a weighted stylus that wears completely through a film by oscillating or reciprocating back and forth along a linear path until an electrical circuit is completed shutting down the test.   1.2  Units— The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. Combining values from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the standard.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.4  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,G220-20,Standard Practice for Replacing Saturated Calomel Reference Electrode (SCE) for Measuring  Electrode Potentials,"Significance and Use  5.1 Electrode potential measurement is an essential step in many electrochemical corrosion test methods and practices.   5.2 The SCE has been widely specified for laboratory tests because it is reliable, accurate, simple to use, and it has been readily available. However, because this device contains mercury, and mercury has recently been banned by some governmental agencies, it may not be available in locations where mercury is banned. As a result, test methods using the SCE may not be possible in locations where mercury is banned. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an alternative reference electrode for these standards.   5.3 The KCl saturated, silver/silver chloride reference electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat KCl), is a satisfactory replacement for the SCE in laboratory test methods and practices. This reference electrode should provide comparable performance and accuracy to the SCE.   5.4 It will be necessary to carry out interlaboratory test programs for each test method where the Ag/AgCl (sat KCl) electrode is specified to replace the SCE, in order to develop the precision of the method using the new reference electrode.  Note 1:  In cases where a test method specifies that either the SCE or the Ag/AgCl (sat KCl) reference electrode may be used, and the ILS program used to develop the precision of the method included significant numbers of participants using each of these reference electrodes, no additional testing is required. Scope  1.1 This practice provides the steps necessary to prepare revisions to standards that specify the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) for measuring or controlling electrode potentials.   1.2 The SCE contains mercury and, as a result, it may not be available in locations where mercury has been banned. This practice covers the selection and use of an alternative reference electrode.   1.3 In test methods where the SCE is specified, it will be necessary to develop a new precision statement using the alternative reference electrode.   1.4 This practice will not apply to electrometric pH determinations where the SCE has been used. (Electrometric pH measurement is an analytical method that is covered elsewhere.)   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  Warning— Mercury has been designated by many regulatory agencies as a hazardous substance that can cause serious medical issues. Mercury, or its vapor, has been demonstrated to be hazardous to health and corrosive to materials. Use caution when handling mercury and mercury-containing products. See the applicable product Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for additional information. The potential exists that selling mercury or mercury-containing products, or both, is prohibited by local or national law.

Cell culture methods have shown good correlation with animal assays and are frequently more sensitive to cytotoxic agents.   4.3 This cell culture test method is suitable for incorporation into specifications and standards for materials to be used in the construction of medical devices that are to be implanted into the human body or placed in contact with tissue fluids or blood on a long-term basis.   4.4 Some biomaterials with a history of safe clinical use in medical devices are cytotoxic. This test method does not imply that all biomaterials must pass this assay to be considered safe for clinical use (Practice F748 ). Scope   1.1 This test method is appropriate for materials in a variety of shapes and for materials that are not necessarily sterile. This test method would be appropriate in situations in which the amount of material is limited. For example, small devices or powders could be placed on the agar and the presence of a zone of inhibition of cell growth could be examined.   1.1.1 This test method is not appropriate for leachables that do not diffuse through agar or agarose.   1.1.2 While the agar layer can act as a cushion to protect the cells from the specimen, there may be materials that are sufficiently heavy to compress the agar and prevent diffusion or to cause mechanical damage to the cells. This test method would not be appropriate for these materials.   1.2 The L-929 cell line was chosen because it has a significant history of use in assays of this type. This is not intended to imply that its use is preferred, only that the L-929 is an established cell line, well characterized and readily available, that has demonstrated reproducible results in several laboratories.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F2258-05(2015),Standard Test Method for Strength Properties of Tissue Adhesives in Tension,"Significance and Use  4.1 The utility, range, and efficacy of adhesives in clinical medicine are well documented in the literature. Whether being used as an adhesive, hemostatic, sealant, or carrier for drugs or growth factors, or both, the scope of adhesive use in clinical medicine continues to expand. There are several factors which are vital to the success and efficacy of a medical tissue adhesive including, ( 1 ) adequate tissue bonding strength, ( 2 ) tissue compatibility, ( 3 ) acceptable biodegradable properties when the adhesive is used internally, ( 4 ) availability, ( 5 ) ease of application, and ( 6 ) cost.   4.2 Medical adhesives are currently used for a variety of applications and tissue types. Applications range from fixation of external tissues to internal application for use with either similar or dissimilar opposing surfaces. While the biological or chemical makeup, or both, of the adhesive may define its characteristics, additional mechanical factors including adhesive volume or method of application, or both, may also contribute significantly toward the performance of the adhesive. In an effort to fairly and adequately quantify adhesive bonding strength for medical adhesives, it is important to develop a consistent, reproducible testing standard for evaluative and comparative purposes. Due to the fact that the adhesives will be used on or in living tissues, a readily available biological testing surface is preferred.   4.3 The data generated from a standardized testing method on biologic tissue may vary from that found in vivo , however, testing results should offer valuable information on the potential bonding capacity and for the preparation of subsequent in vivo experiments.   4.4 The complexity and variety of individual applications for tissue adhesive devices, even within a single indicated use (surgical procedure), is such that the results of a tensile test are not suitable for determining allowable design stresses without thorough analysis and understanding of the application and adhesive behaviors.   4.5 This test method may be used for comparing adhesives or bonding processes for susceptibility to fatigue and environmental changes, but such comparisons must be made with great caution since different adhesives may respond differently to varying conditions. Scope  1.1 This test method is intended to provide a means for comparison of the adhesive strengths of tissue adhesives intended for use as surgical adhesives or sealants, or both, on soft tissue.

,F2338-09(2020),Standard Test Method for  Nondestructive Detection of Leaks in Packages by Vacuum Decay  Method,"Significance and Use  5.1 Leaks in medical device, pharmaceutical, and food packages may result in the ingress of unwanted gases (most commonly oxygen), harmful microbiological, or particulate contaminants. Package leaks may appear as imperfections in the package components themselves or at the seal juncture between mated components. The ability to detect leaks is necessary to ensure consistency and integrity of packages.   5.2 After initial set-up and calibration, individual test operation may be semi-automatic, automatic, or manual. The test method permits non-destructive detection of leaks not visibly detectable. The test method does not require the introduction of any extraneous materials or substances, such as dyes or gases. However, it is important to physically mask or block off any package porous barrier surface during the test to prevent rapid loss of chamber vacuum resulting primarily from gas migration through the porous surface. Leak detection is based solely on the ability to detect the change in pressure inside the test chamber resulting from gas or vapor egress from a package challenged with vacuum.   5.3 This test is a useful research tool for optimizing package sealing parameters and for comparatively evaluating various packages and materials. This test method is also applicable to production settings as it is rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive, making it useful for either 100 % on-line testing or to perform tests on a statistical sampling from the production operation.   5.4 Leak test results that exceed the permissible limits for the vacuum decay test are indicated by audible or visual signal responses, or both. Scope  1.1  Test Packages— Packages that can be nondestructively evaluated by this test method include:   1.1.1 Rigid and semi-rigid non-lidded trays.   1.1.2 Trays or cups sealed with porous barrier lidding material.   1.1.3 Rigid, nonporous packages.   1.1.4 Flexible, nonporous packages.   1.2  Leaks Detected— This test method detects package leaks by measuring the rise in pressure (vacuum loss) in an enclosed evacuated test chamber containing the test package. Vacuum loss results from leakage of test package headspace gases and/or volatilization of test package liquid contents located in or near the leak. When testing for leaks that may be partially or completely plugged with the package’s liquid contents, the test chamber is evacuated to a pressure below the liquid’s vaporization pressure. All methods require a test chamber to contain the test package and a leak detection system designed with one or more pressure transducers. Test method sensitivities cited below were determined using specific product-package systems selected for the precision and bias studies summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 also lists other examples of relevant product-package systems that can be tested for leakage by vacuum decay.    1.2.1  Trays or Cups (Non-lidded) (Air Leakage)— Hole or crack defects in the wall of the tray/cup of at least 50 μm in diameter can be detected. Nonlidded trays were tested at a Target Vacuum of –4·E4 Pa (–400 mbar).   1.2.2  Trays Sealed with Porous Barrier Lidding Material (Headspace Gas Leakage)— Hole or crack defects in the wall of the tray/cup of at least 100 μm in diameter can be detected. Channel defects in the seal area (made using wires of 125 μm in diameter) can be detected. Severe seal bonding defects in both continuous adhesive and dot matrix adhesive package systems can be detected. Slightly incomplete dot matrix adhesive bonding defects can also be detected. All porous barrier lidding material packages were tested at a Target Vacuum of –4·E4 Pa (–400 mbar). The sensitivity of the test for porous lidded packages is approximately E-2 Pa·m 3 ·s -1 using a calibrated volumetric airflow meter.   1.2.3  Rigid, Nonporous Packages (Headspace Gas Leakage)— Hole defects of at least 5 μm in diameter can be detected. Plastic bottles with screw caps were tested at a target vacuum of –5·E4 Pa (–500 mbar). Using a calibrated volumetric airflow meter, the sensitivity of the test is approximately E-3.4 Pa·m 3 ·s -1 . Air-filled glass syringes were tested at a target vacuum of –7.5·E4 Pa (+250 mbar absolute) and again at a target vacuum of about +1 mbar absolute. The sensitivity of both tests is approximately E-4.1 Pa·m 3 ·s -1 using a calibrated volumetric airflow meter.   1.2.4  Rigid, Nonporous Packages (Liquid Leakage)— Hole defects of at least 5 μm in diameter can be detected. This detection limit was verified using a population of water-filled glass syringes tested at a target vacuum of about +1 mbar absolute.   1.2.5  Flexible, Nonporous Packages (Gas or Liquid Leakage)— Such packages may also be tested by the vacuum decay method. Sensitivity data for flexible packages were not included in the precision and bias studies, although the use of vacuum decay for testing such packages is well known.   1.3  Test Results— Test results are qualitative (Accept/Reject). Acceptance criteria are established by comparing quantitative baseline vacuum decay measurements obtained from control, non-leaking packages to measurements obtained using leaking packages, and to measurements obtained with the introduction of simulated leaks using a calibrated gas flow meter.   1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E2232-21,Standard Guide for  Selection and Use of Mathematical Methods for Calculating Absorbed  Dose in Radiation Processing Applications,"Significance and Use  4.1  Use as an Analytical Tool— Mathematical methods provide an analytical tool to be employed for many applications related to absorbed dose determinations in radiation processing. Mathematical calculations may not be used as a substitute for routine dosimetry in some applications (for example, medical device sterilization, food irradiation).   4.2  Dose Calculation— Absorbed-dose calculations may be performed for a variety of photon/electron environments and irradiator geometries.   4.3  Evaluate Process Effectiveness— Mathematical models may be used to evaluate the impact of changes in product composition, loading configuration, and irradiator design on dose distribution.   4.4  Complement or Supplement to Dosimetry— Dose calculations may be used to establish a detailed understanding of dose distribution, providing a spatial resolution not obtainable through measurement. Calculations may be used to reduce the number of dosimeters required to characterize a procedure or process (for example, dose mapping).   4.5  Alternative to Dosimetry— Dose calculations may be used when dosimetry is impractical (for example, granular materials, materials with complex geometries, material contained in a package where dosimetry is not practical or possible).   4.6  Facility Design— Dose calculations are often used in the design of a new irradiator and can be used to help optimize dose distribution in an existing facility or radiation process. The use of modeling in irradiator design can be found in Refs ( 2- 7 ) .   4.7  Validation— The validation of the model should be done through comparison with reliable and traceable dosimetric measurements. The purpose of validation is to demonstrate that the mathematical method makes reliable predictions of dose and other transport quantities. Validation compares predictions or theory to the results of an appropriate experiment. The degree of validation is commensurate with the application. Guidance is given in the documents referenced in Annex A2 .   4.8  Verification— Verification is the confirmation of the mathematical correctness of a computer implementation of a mathematical method. This can be done, for example, by comparing numerical results with known analytic solutions or with other computer codes that have been previously verified. Verification should be done to ensure that the simulation is appropriate for the intended application. Refer to 3.1.24 .  Note 2:  Certain applications of the mathematical model deal with Operational Qualification (OQ), Performance Qualification (PQ) and process control in radiation processing such as the sterilization of healthcare products. The application and use of the mathematical model in these applications may have to meet regulatory requirements. Refer to Section 6 for prerequisites for application of a mathematical method and Section 8 for requirements before routine use of the mathematical method.   4.9  Uncertainty— An absorbed dose prediction should be accompanied by an estimate of overall uncertainty, as it is with absorbed-dose measurement (refer to ISO/ASTM 51707 and JCGM100:2008 and JCGM200:2012). In many cases, absorbed-dose measurement helps to establish the uncertainty in the dose calculation.   4.10 This guide should not be used as the only reference in the selection and use of mathematical models. The user is encouraged to contact individuals who are experienced in mathematical modelling and to read the relevant publications in order to select the best tool for their application. Radiation processing is an evolving field and the references cited in the annotated examples of Annex A6 are representative of the various published applications. Where a method is validated with dosimetry, it becomes a benchmark for that particular application. Scope  1.1 This guide describes different mathematical methods that may be used to calculate absorbed dose and criteria for their selection. Absorbed-dose calculations can determine the effectiveness of the radiation process, estimate the absorbed-dose distribution in product, or supplement or complement, or both, the measurement of absorbed dose.   1.2 Radiation processing is an evolving field and annotated examples are provided in Annex A6 to illustrate the applications where mathematical methods have been successfully applied. While not limited by the applications cited in these examples, applications specific to neutron transport, radiation therapy and shielding design are not addressed in this document.   1.3 This guide covers the calculation of radiation transport of electrons and photons with energies up to 25 MeV.   1.4 The mathematical methods described include Monte Carlo, point kernel, discrete ordinate, semi-empirical and empirical methods.   1.5 This guide is limited to the use of general purpose software packages for the calculation of the transport of charged or uncharged particles and photons, or both, from various types of sources of ionizing radiation. This standard is limited to the use of these software packages or other mathematical methods for the determination of spatial dose distributions for photons emitted following the decay of 137 Cs or 60 Co, for energetic electrons from particle accelerators, or for X-rays generated by electron accelerators.   1.6 This guide assists the user in determining if mathematical methods are a useful tool. This guide may assist the user in selecting an appropriate method for calculating absorbed dose. The user must determine whether any of these mathematical methods are appropriate for the solution to their specific application and what, if any, software to apply.  Note 1:  The user is urged to apply these predictive techniques while being aware of the need for experience and also the inherent limitations of both the method and the available software.

In order to ascertain the role of particles in stimulating such responses, the nature of the responses, and the consequences of the responses, established protocols are needed. This is an emerging, rapidly developing area, and the information gained from standard protocols is necessary to interpret cellular responses to particles and to determine if these correlate with in vivo responses. Since there are many possible and established ways of determining responses, a single standard protocol is not stated. However, well described protocols are needed to compare results from different investigators using the same materials and to compare biological responses for evaluating (ranking) different materials. For laboratories without established protocols, recommendations are given and indicated with an asterisk (*).   1.2 Since the purpose of the following test procedures is to predict the response in human tissues, the use of human (preferably macrophage lineage) cells is recommended. However, the use of non-macrophage cell lineage or the use of cells from non-human and non-primate sources may be acceptable. The source of the cells or the cell line used should be justified based on the cellular responses under test and/or tissue of interest.

This guide contains a listing of those dimensional attributes that are directly related to the clinical utility and performance of these devices, along with recommendations for consistent methods of measuring these attributes and presenting the information for use in clinical decision making. This guide can be used by the manufacturers and researchers of stents to provide consistency of measurement and labeling of these dimensional characteristics. It may have use in the regulation of these devices by appropriate authorities.   4.2 The dimensional attributes included in this guide are those that are deemed related to or possibly predictive of successful clinical performance of the stent based on prior clinical experience; however, because of the myriad patient and medical factors that influence the clinical outcome of any individual treatment, conformance of a stent and delivery system with the recommendations in this guide should not be interpreted as a guarantee of clinical success in any individual patient or group of patients. Scope  1.1 This guide covers the identification of and recommended measurement methods for those dimensional attributes of vascular stents that are deemed relevant to successful clinical performance. The delivery system packaged with and labeled specifically for use during the placement of the stent is also included within the scope of this guide.   1.2 This guide addresses only the dimensional characteristics of stents. Material property and stent functional characteristics are not addressed herein. All dimensional characteristics described in this guide refer to in vitro (“bench-top”) characterization. Because of variable patient factors, for example, vessel compliance, the actual in vivo characteristics may be slightly different.   1.3 This guide includes recommendations generally applicable to balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents fabricated from metals and metal alloys. It does not specifically address any attributes unique to coated stents or polymeric or biodegradable stents, although the application of this guide to those products is not precluded.   1.4 While they are not specifically included within the scope of this guide, stents indicated for placement in nonvascular locations, such as the esophagus or bile duct, also might be characterized by the methods contained herein. Likewise, this guide does not include recommendations for endovascular grafts (“stent-grafts”) or other conduit devices commonly used to treat aneurysmal disease or peripheral vessel trauma or to provide vascular access, although some information included herein may be applicable to those devices.   1.5 This guide does not include recommendations for balloon catheters sold as stand-alone angioplasty catheters, even though some of those catheters may be used for the delivery of unmounted stents supplied without a delivery system.

Typically, immune system recognition of foreign material leads to encapsulation of the material and an aggressive inflammatory response, causing the ultimate rejection or other failure of the product.   4.2 As described above, decellularization is a recognized technique which allows the use of ECM-derived products in medical treatments with a reduced risk of an adverse host immune response and immune rejection by disrupting and removing cells and/or cell contents while aiming to preserve significant features of the ECM structure and/or composition. More complete decellularization is often associated with a beneficial response ( 1 , 2 ) 6 but can also be associated with the loss of important ECM components and the loss of structural or biomechanical integrity from the tissue during the decellularization process ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . Therefore, given the typical objective of producing a product that does not elicit an adverse immune response while maintaining the integrity of the tissue for its intended surgical application, this guide presents a standard approach to the evaluation of decellularization processes, including assessment of adequate decellularization to achieve this end.   4.3 An ideal decellularization process would completely remove source tissue cells and associated cellular content from a tissue or organ, while minimizing unwanted effects on the remaining ECM. However, a more widely encountered and practical representation of an optimized decellularization process exhibits partial removal and/or disruption of resident cells and cellular material to levels within a set of product-specific ranges (acceptance criteria). This guide is intended to aid in evaluating a decellularization process through the mechanisms and extent of decellularization and any potential impacts on the remaining dECM.   4.4 This standard provides a guide to the following steps in evaluating an extracellular matrix decellularization process:   4.4.1 Selecting attributes and test methods for characterization (Section 5 )   4.4.2 Developing decellularization acceptance criteria for selected attributes (Section 6 )   4.4.3 Documenting and analyzing the decellularization process flow (Section 7 )   4.4.4 Performing a characterization of the decellularization process by testing decellularized ECM materials using the selected attributes, methods, and acceptance criteria (Section 8 )   4.5 Decellularization processes vary widely in practice, utilizing a variety of reagents, temperatures, pressures, and/or mechanical forces in parallel and/or in sequence. While any one factor may act through consistent mechanisms, its effect will vary according to the decellularization process in its entirety as well as the particular tissue structure. As such, each part of a decellularization process should be understood and analyzed within the context of the complete process sequence and its action upon the type of tissue. For example, a process developed for dermis will likely not translate directly to a heart valve and the doubling of process time will affect each process differently, so the decellularization process will have to be adjusted to account for the difference in tissue properties and desired attributes at the conclusion of the process. Within the context of this guide, analysis of a processing step should not suggest material testing. Analysis is meant to demonstrate an understanding of the relevant mechanisms of decellularization and the relevant mechanisms of adverse effects on the ECM material.   4.6 Decellularization acceptance criteria and ECM integrity acceptance criteria should be developed based on the intended use of the dECM material. This guide suggests some considerations that should be used to develop and justify acceptance criteria.   4.6.1 Decellularization acceptance criteria already established for a source ECM and decellularization process allow for controlled changes to the decellularization process. Significant changes include changes to the processing mechanisms, reagents/materials, reagent concentrations, and controls as well as changes in source ECM materials. Prior to any significant change to a decellularization process, a decellularization process analysis should be conducted on the process steps which are subject to change. In addition, testing against the established decellularization acceptance criteria should be conducted on dECM material produced with the proposed process changes. A risk management process may then be utilized to ensure that any risks associated with the proposed changes are acceptable.   4.7 Measurements of decellularization attributes using the source extracellular matrix material as a reference can provide a valuable frame of reference and determination of percent change for exploratory and informational purposes. However, acceptance criteria based on percent change from the source material are more prone to variability in the final product due to variability in the source material. Acceptance criteria based on measurements of the dECM alone are more stable and simpler to implement.   4.7.1 The preparation of decellularized medical products involves variability originating in the source material as well as the processing; both types of variability can affect the consistency of the end product (dECM) and its performance in meeting predetermined acceptance criteria. A complete characterization of a decellularization process will include statistical ranges for each measured attribute. Statistical correlations may be explored to connect variation in source material and processing to end product attributes. These correlations can help prioritize source material and process controls to address uncontrolled variability. Scope   1.1 This document provides guidance on the characterization and evaluation of the decellularization processes used to produce decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) materials which will be used as medical products in direct or indirect contact with the body. The decellularization process may be performed on tissue from human or other mammalian sources or produced in vitro from human or other mammalian cells. The dECM may or may not be recellularized prior to use. Decellularized ECM material derived from non-mammalian tissue or cells and decellularized ECM material used for non-medical purposes may follow the framework provided but may require additional considerations outside the scope of this document.   1.2 Biological tissues are composed of a structural extracellular matrix (ECM) and embedded cells. The intent of a decellularization process is to disrupt and/or remove cells and cellular components from an ECM material while maintaining key structural and/or compositional properties of the material. Decellularization comprises process steps intended or expected to result or aid in the disruption of source tissue cells and/or removal of cellular content from the material undergoing decellularization. Actions that are intended to rinse or otherwise remove decellularization reagents or by-products should also be considered in that context as part of the decellularization process. Purifications or other isolations of specific ECM components are not considered decellularization and are outside the scope of this document.   1.3 This document describes relevant parameters of decellularization processes used to prepare extracellular matrix materials as medical products.   1.4 This document provides guidance on the measurement of specific and general properties of dECM. This includes both the analysis of cellular material as well as the assessment of the effects of decellularization on dECM properties such as composition, structure, and material properties.   1.5 This document does not provide guidance on the assessment of the host response subsequent to the implantation or other in vivo placement of dECM medical products. Such assessments should instead be conducted as part of biocompatibility studies or other safety and efficacy studies. At a minimum it is recommended that the finished product composed of dECM material shall be assessed in a relevant model that represents the biological responses that the product is expected to experience to ensure that the final material is functioning in accordance with design intentions. An in vivo model will generally be used, but cellular or ex vivo models may also be satisfactory when appropriate.   1.6 This document provides guidance on determining pertinent quality attributes as well as developing and assessing acceptance criteria related to ensuring the consistent evaluation and use of decellularization in manufacturing medical products. Acceptance criteria should address the adequacy of cellular disruption and removal of cellular remnants. Acceptance criteria should define acceptable levels for retention of extracellular matrix components. Acceptance criteria may place limits on damage to retained components. Acceptance criteria should place limits on the persistence of decellularization reagents. This document also provides recommendations on developing process parameters and associated process controls.   1.6.1 This guide recommends attributes as representative measures of decellularization in the direct function of removing cells and cell components. These attributes can also be used to show process consistency, capability, or equivalency. Recommendation of these attributes does not confer additional significance related to product safety and performance.   1.6.2 No consensus has been established regarding decellularization thresholds or classifications. This guide therefore cannot suggest acceptance criteria and instead recommends commonly measured attributes to develop acceptance criteria specific to the design of each unique material and its intended use.   1.7 Decellularized products will require evidence of safety and/or efficacy beyond that related to evaluating the decellularization process. Commonly referenced standards include the ISO 10993 series (see ISO 10993-1) for biocompatibility of medical devices and the ISO 22442 series for medical devices utilizing animal tissues and their derivatives. These assessments are not in the scope of this document, though they may help to identify relevant functional characteristics and test methods as discussed in 5.2.9 .   1.8  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F3136-22,Standard Test Method for Oxygen Gas Transmission Rate through Plastic Film and Sheeting  using a Dynamic Accumulation Method,"Significance and Use  5.1 The Oxygen Transmission Rate is an important determinant of packaging functionality afforded by packaging materials for a wide variety of packaged products including food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In some applications, sufficient oxygen must be allowed to permeate into the package. In others, the oxygen ingress must be minimized to maintain product quality.   5.2 Other ASTM Standard Methods to measure the oxygen transmission rate are described in Test Method D3985 and Test Method F2622 .

,E3025-22,Standard Guide for Tiered Approach to Detection and Characterization of Silver  Nanomaterials in Textiles,"Significance and Use  4.1 Natural and manufactured textiles fibers can be treated with chemicals to provide enhanced antimicrobial (fungi, bacteria, viruses) properties. In some cases, silver nanomaterials may be used to treat textile fibers ( 1 ) . 6 Silver nanomaterials are used to treat a wide array of consumer textile products, including, but not limited to, various clothing; primary garments (shirts, pants), outer wear (gloves, jackets), inner wear (socks and underwear), children’s clothing (sleepwear); children’s plush toys; bath towels and bedding (sheets, pillows); and medical devices (for example, wound dressings and face masks) ( 2 ) .   4.2 There are many different chemical and physical forms of silver that are used to treat textiles and an overview of this topic is provided in Appendix X1 .   4.3 Several applicable techniques for detection and characterization of silver are listed and described in Appendix X2 so that users of this guide may understand the suitability of a particular technique for their specific textile and silver measurement need.   4.4 There are many different reasons to assay for silver nanomaterials in a textile at any point in a product’s life cycle. For example, a producer may want to verify that a textile meets their internal quality control specifications or a regulator may want to understand the properties of silver nanomaterials used to make a consumer textile product under their jurisdiction or what quantity of silver nanomaterial is potentially available for release from the treated textile during the washing process or during product use. Regardless of the specific reason, a structured approach to detect and characterize silver nanomaterials present in a textile will facilitate measurements and data comparison. Detection and characterterization of silver in textiles is one component of an overall risk assessment.   4.5 The approach presented in this guide (see Fig. 1 ) consists of three sequential tiers: obtain a textile sample (Section 7 ), detection of a silver nanomaterial (Section 8 ), and characterization of a silver nanomaterial (Section 9 ). If no forms of silver are detected in a textile sample using appropriate (fit for purpose) analytical techniques then testing can be terminated. If silver is detected, but present in a non-nanoscale form, the textile is a chemical or bulk silver-containing material. Silver ions may be released from silver-containing materials, and under reducing conditions these can transform into nanoscale silver-containing particles. If nanoscale silver is detected, one concludes that the textile contains a silver nanomaterial. Subsequent measurements can characterize the chemical and physical properties of the silver nanomaterial.  FIG. 1 Tiered Approach for Determining if a Textile Contains a Silver Nanomaterial (*It might not be possible to know how the nanomaterial formed in the textile. It may have been engineered or intentionally applied or transformed from another silver source.)   4.6 Numerous techniques are available to detect and characterize silver nanomaterials in textiles. The breadth of options can cause confusion for those interested in developing an analytical strategy and selecting appropriate techniques. Some techniques apply only to certain chemical forms of silver and all have limited ranges of applicability with respect to a measurand. No single technique is suitable to both detect and fully characterize silver nanomaterials in textiles. This guide describes and defines a tiered approach using commercially available measurement techniques so that manufacturers, producers, analysts, policymakers, regulators, and others may make informed and appropriate choices in assaying silver nanomaterials in textiles within a standardized framework. The user is cautioned that this guide does not purport to address all conceivable textile analysis scenarios and may not be appropriate for all situations. In all instances, professional judgment is necessary.   4.7 This guide provides a tiered approach to determine an efficacious and efficient procedure for detecting and characterizing silver in textiles and determine whether any silver nanomaterial is present. This tiered approach may also be used to determine whether a reported measurand for silver nanomaterials in a textile was obtained in an appropriate and meaningful way.   4.8 Material property measurement depends on the method. Caution is required when comparing data for the same measurand from techniques that operate on different physical or chemical principles or with different measurement ranges.   4.9 The amount of silver in a textile might decrease over time. Silver metal and silver compounds can react with oxygen and other oxidation-reduction (redox) active agents present in the environment to form soluble silver species. These soluble silver species can be released by contact with moisture (for example, from ambient humidity, washing, body sweat, rain, or other sources). As described in Appendix X1 , release of soluble silver species may occur at varying rates. Release rates depend on many characteristics, including chemical nature, surface area, crystallinity, and shape, where the silver is applied to the textile (on the fiber surface, in the volume of the fiber, and so forth), and in what form the silver is applied to the textile (discrete particles, with carriers, and so forth). The condition and age of textile test samples must be considered when drawing temporal inferences from the results, as only a moment in time of the textile life cycle will be captured in the results.   4.10 Textile acquisition, storage, handling, and preparation can also affect silver content. Scope  1.1 This guide covers the use of a tiered approach for detection and characterization of silver nanomaterials in consumer textile products, which can include some medical devices (for example, wound dressings or face masks), made of any combination of natural or manufactured fibers.   1.2 This guide covers, but is not limited to, fabrics and parts (for example, thread, batting) used during the manufacture of textiles and production of consumer textile products that may contain silver-based nanomaterials. It does not apply to analysis of silver nanomaterials in non-consumer textile product matrices nor does it cover thin film silver coatings with only one dimension in the nanoscale.   1.3 This guide is intended to serve as a resource for manufacturers, producers, analysts, policymakers, regulators, and others with an interest in textiles.   1.4 This guide is presented in the specific context of measurement of silver nanomaterials; however, the structured approach described herein is applicable to other nanomaterials in consumer textile products, including some medical devices.   1.5  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

This test method also provides a procedure for determining the compatibility of cleaning agents with the Material of Construction prior to starting tests. Based on the outcome of the testing, suitable cleaning agents may be selected for further cleaning process development (see Guide D6361/D6361M ).   5.2 The potential critical cleaning parameters related to the cleaning agent(s) under study may also be examined using these tests. Potentially critical cleaning parameters include cleaning agent concentration, temperature, time, pH, foaming, type and strength of ultrasonic energy or agitation (if used), and others. These parameters may be varied (for example, using Design of Experiments) to determine their potential optimal settings for actual use. Scope  1.1 This test method covers a procedure for evaluating the effectiveness and capability of cleaning agents to remove contamination to the desired level. This includes removing drug residues from manufacturing equipment and residues from medical devices (Guide E3106 ), as well as systems for oxygen service.   1.2 The test coupons/beakers described in this standard provide a representative surface to which contamination can be applied and tested for the ability of a cleaning agent to remove it.   1.3 This test method is a laboratory scale approximation and the actual effectiveness of a particular cleaning agent depends upon the method (temperature, agitation, concentration, etc.) in which it is used and the characteristics of the article being cleaned, such as size, shape, and material.

The types of radiation used may be gamma radiation (typically from cobalt-60 sources), X-radiation or accelerated electrons.   1.3 This standard provides terms and definitions for dosimetry for radiation processing concepts dealing with procedures related to operational qualification, performance qualification, and routine processing that may influence absorbed dose in the products, and types of dosimetry systems that may be used during calibration or on a routine basis as part of quality assurance in commercial radiation processing of products.   1.4 When selecting terms and definitions, special care has been taken to include the terms that need to be defined, that is to say, either because the definitions are essential to the correct understanding of the corresponding concepts or because some specific ambiguities need to be addressed.   1.5 The “Discussion” appended to certain definitions offers clarification or examples to facilitate understanding of the concepts described. In certain cases, miscellaneous information is also included, for example, the units in which a quantity is normally measured, recommended parameter values, references, etc.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2638-22,Standard Test Method for Using Aerosol Filtration for Measuring the Performance of Porous  Packaging Materials as a Surrogate Microbial Barrier,"Significance and Use  6.1 This test method has been developed as a result of research performed by Air Dispersion Limited (Manchester, UK) and funded by the Barrier Test Consortium Limited. The results of this research have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. 4 This research demonstrated that testing the barrier performance of porous packaging materials using microorganisms correlates with measuring the filtration efficiency of the materials.   6.2 This test method does not require the use of microbiological method; in addition, the test method can be conducted in a rapid and timely manner.   6.3 When measuring the filtration efficiency of porous packaging materials a typical filtration efficiency curve is determined (see Fig. 1 ). Since the arc of these curves is dependent upon the characteristics of each individual material, the appropriate way to make comparison among materials is using the parameter that measures maximum penetration through the material.  FIG. 1 A Typical Curve Showing Penetration as a Function of Flow Rate  Note 1:  The point of maximum penetration is indicated by the upward pointing triangle.   6.4 The particle filtration method is a quantitative procedure for determining the microbial barrier properties of materials using a challenge of 1.0 µm particles over range of pressure differentials from near zero to approximately 30 cm water column (WC) (2942 Pa). This test method is based upon the research of Tallentire and Sinclair 4 and uses physical test methodology to allow for a rapid determination of microbial barrier performance. Scope  1.1 This test method measures the aerosol filtration performance of porous packaging materials by creating a defined aerosol of 1.0 μm particles and assessing the filtration efficiency of the material using either single or dual particle counters.   1.2 This test method is applicable to porous materials used to package terminally sterilized medical devices.   1.3 The intent of this test apparatus is to determine the flow rate through a material at which maximum penetration occurs.   1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard.

,E2805-18,Standard Practice for  Measurement of the Biological Activity of Ricin,"Significance and Use   5.1 The CFT assay provides a sensitive and reliable method to detect ricin biological activity and results can be generated within 3 h. The assay measures the amount of ricin biological activity when compared to a known ricin standard and provides a quantitative measurement for active ricin.   5.2 The lower limit of quantitation and the upper limit of quantitation for ricin using the CFT assay were measured at 10 ng/mL and 170 ng/mL, respectively ( 5 ) .   5.3 This practice is focused on the measurement of reference materials and not environmental samples. Additional control runs may be needed for measurements of environmental samples to ensure that the presence of additional materials in the samples (also referred to as the matrix) will not interfere with the measurements.   5.4 The CFT assay may be used to determine the presence of active ricin in forensic or bioterrorist samples if the appropriate controls are utilized to ensure valid results ( 5 ) .   5.5 The methods described in this document measure the biological activity of ricin and do not detect the presence of inactivated ricin in a given sample.   5.6 Ricin reference materials have a number of applications, such as testing detection devices, laboratory instruments, environmental sampling methods, disinfection studies, and basic research. Scope   1.1 This guide is intended for the manufacturers and users of ricin reference material. Ricin reference materials are well-characterized materials that can be used to test detection devices and calibrate laboratory measurements. It is anticipated that ricin reference materials will be characterized by biochemical methods in addition to the measurement of biological activity.   1.2 This practice details the measurement of ricin biological activity using a cell-free translation (CFT) assay ( 4 ) .   1.3 The CFT assay has been developed for use in any biotechnology laboratory where determination or confirmation of ricin biological activity is required.   1.4 The CFT assay has been validated by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) VP-016 Validation of Cell-Free Translation Assay for the Detection of Ricin Toxin Biological Activities in compliance ( 5 ) with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) Regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR Part 58). Strict adherence to the protocol is necessary for validity of the test results.   1.5  Appendix X1 and Appendix X2 also provide guidance for the measurement of the biological activity of ricin using cell-based assays and the use of synthetic enzyme substrates.   1.6 Ricin is a category 2 select agent and acquisition of the ricin standard must adhere to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulations. Ricin is listed on the select agent list (42 CFR Part 72). 3 The possession, transfer, and use of ricin are restricted under the Public Health Security Preparedness Act (CRS Report RL31263 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 107-188): Provision and Changes to Preexisting law). Access to stores of ricin is limited (USA Patriot Act, P.L. 107-56). Ricin is also a prohibited substance under the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CRS Report RL31559 Proliferation Control Regimes: Background and Status).   1.7 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F3502-24,Standard Specification for Barrier Face Coverings,"Scope  1.1 This specification is intended to help ensure barrier face coverings meeting the stated requirements provide ( 1 ) a means of source control for individual wearers by reducing expelled aerosols from the wearer’s nose and mouth into the air; and ( 2 ) a degree of particulate filtration that potentially reduces the amount of aerosols inhaled by the wearer.  Note 1:  The source control/protection provided by barrier face coverings depends on several factors not considered in this specification, such as material degradation from wearer challenges including perspiration, talking, sneezing, and the length of time the barrier face covering is worn. Further research is needed to expand the evidence base for the protective effect of face coverings and, in particular, to identify the combinations of materials that maximize both their blocking and filtering effectiveness, as well as fit, comfort, durability, and consumer appeal. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html.)  Note 2:  There are currently no established methods for measuring outward leakage from a barrier face covering, medical mask, or respirator. Nothing in this specification addresses or implies a quantitative assessment of outward leakage and no claims can be made about the degree to which a barrier face covering reduces expired human-generated aerosols.   1.2 This specification establishes minimum design, performance (testing), labeling, user instruction, reporting and classification, and conformity assessment requirements for barrier face coverings.   1.2.1 Design criteria include setting minimum areas of face coverage over the wearer’s nose and mouth, prohibiting open vents or valves, requiring a means for retaining the barrier face covering on the wearer’s head, and providing a representation of product sizing. Manufacturers are further required to perform a design analysis for assessing leakage of exhaled air from the barrier face covering where the general approach is described in the product report. Manufacturers are permitted to conduct quantitative testing as specified in this specification to supplement the design analysis. Accessories, such as braces or other devices that allow the barrier face covering to better conform to the wearer’s face, are addressed as part of this specification if used for the purpose of reducing leakage.   1.2.2 Performance and testing criteria define minimum barrier face covering filtration efficiency and airflow resistance performance properties. Sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency represents the ability to capture and reduce respirable aerosols that potentially contain viruses and bacteria. Airflow resistance represents the wearer’s ease of breathing or breathability while wearing the barrier face covering. The impact of repeated cleaning or laundering on continued performance is applied for measuring performance properties for those barrier face coverings that are intended for reuse. Manufacturers are permitted to also provide test results for bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) as supplemental information to the mandatory performance measurement of sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency.  Note 3:  The principal performance criteria for barrier face covering determined by testing are sub-micron particle filtration efficiency and airflow resistance. Quantitative leakage assessment testing is optional for information purposes and is not required. This testing is not likely to be representative of outward leakage from the barrier face covering and should not be claimed to represent the amount of source control offered by the face covering. Bacterial filtration efficiency testing is also optional and not required. It is significantly different than sub-micron filtration efficiency, and the results of BFE testing cannot be interchanged or directly compared.   1.2.3 Labeling requirements specify the minimum content for labels that appear on the barrier face covering, its immediate packaging, and if different, point-of-sale packaging.   1.2.4 User instructions are required to guide selection and sizing, proper use (positioning and adjustment), and care including cleaning or laundering if product reuse is intended; inform on product cautions and limitations; and describe product replacement and disposal procedures.   1.2.5 Conformity assessment is demonstrated with a Supplier Declaration of Conformity (SDOC) following Guide F3050 , Annex A3, Model A. The SDOC states that each barrier face covering labeled as compliant has met all of the requirements of this specification including design criteria, performance criteria, test methods, labeling, and user information. Additionally, conformance to this specification requires that sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency and airflow resistance tests have been performed by a laboratory accredited for conducting these tests.  Note 4:  This specification does not provide for any form of provisional, limited, or partial conformance of barrier face coverings since their compliance with this specification is a function of meeting all performance requirements, including specific filtration efficiency and breathability requirements, as well as all applicable design, labeling, reporting, and user information requirements.   1.3 This specification addresses barrier face coverings that are either disposable or reusable.   1.4 This specification does not address the unique additional performance attributes of barrier face coverings that exist for certain applications, such as flame-resistant apparel used in environments where there are flame, high heat, electrical arc, or related hazards, but does recommend that barrier face coverings also conform to other standards as applicable.   1.5 This specification does not address the use of antimicrobial or antiviral materials, finishes, or mechanisms, nor the use of drugs, biologics, or nanoparticles in barrier face coverings. This specification also does not address the efficacy of cleaning agents or other chemicals for cleaning, disinfecting, or sanitizing barrier face coverings.  Note 5:  Claims made about the use of antimicrobial materials, finishes, or mechanisms; or the use of drugs, biologics, or nanoparticles in any product subject the manufacturer to regulatory oversight by government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the United States, which applies additional safety and efficacy requirements to these products. See 5.1.2 for the requirement of nontoxic and non-irritating materials used in the construction of barrier face coverings.   1.6 This specification does not address requirements for medical face masks, which are covered in Specification F2100 .   1.7 Nothing in this specification is intended to contradict or replace criteria that are established in 42 CFR Part 84 for air-purifying respirators or requirements for use of respirators in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134.   1.8 Nothing in this specification is intended to imply that barrier face coverings qualify as approved respiratory protection devices or have FDA clearance for use in a healthcare setting.   1.9 Nothing in this specification is intended to imply that barrier face coverings should be placed on very young children (<2 years), anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove barrier face coverings without assistance.   1.10 The values stated in SI units or in other units shall be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in each system must be used independently of the other, without combining values in any way.  Note 6:  There are several aspects that relate to the material composition and design of barrier face coverings that are not addressed in this specification but warrant attention relative to their safety, health effects, and impact on the environment, including but not limited to: leaching of potentially toxic finishes, inhalable toxic substances from materials, and bioburden inhibitors subject to regulatory oversight.   1.11  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.12  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F2791-24,Standard Guide for  Assessment of Surface Texture of Non-Porous Biomaterials in  Two Dimensions,"Significance and Use  4.1 The term “surface texture” is used to describe the local deviations of a surface from an ideal shape. Surface texture usually consists of long wavelength repetitive features that occur as results of chatter, vibration, or heat treatments during the manufacture of implants. Short wavelength features superimposed on the long wavelength features of the surface, which may arise from polishing or etching of the implant, are referred to as roughness.   4.2 This guide provides an overview of techniques that are available for measuring the surface in terms of Cartesian coordinates and the parameters used to describe surface texture. It is important to appreciate that it is not possible to measure surface texture per se, but to derive values for parameters that can be used to describe it. ISO has published a series of standards on surface texture measurements that may be consulted for more information (ISO 3274, ISO 4287, ISO 4288, ISO 5436-2, ISO 10993-19, ISO 12179, ISO 13565-1, ISO 19606, ISO 21920-1, ISO 21920-2, ISO 21920-3, ISO 25178-1, ISO 25178-2, ISO 25178-3, ISO 25178-6, ISO 25178-70, ISO 25178-71, ISO 25178-72, ISO 25178-73, ISO 25178-600, ISO 25178-601, ISO 25178-602, ISO 25178-603, ISO 25178-604, ISO 25178-605, ISO 25178-606, ISO 25178-607, ISO 25178-700, ISO 25178-701). Scope  1.1 This guide describes some of the more common methods that are available for measuring the topographical features of a surface and provides an overview of the parameters that are used to quantify them. Being able to reliably derive a set of parameters that describe the texture of biomaterial surfaces is a key aspect in the manufacture of safe and effective implantable medical devices that have the potential to trigger an adverse biological reaction in situ .   1.2 This guide is not intended to apply to porous structures with average pore dimensions in excess of approximately 50 nm (0.05 μm).   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E2197-24,"Standard Quantitative Disk Carrier Test Method for  Determining Bactericidal, Virucidal, Fungicidal, Mycobactericidal,  and Sporicidal Activities of Chemicals","Significance and Use  5.1 The design of this test eliminates any loss of viable organisms through wash off, thus making it possible to produce statistically valid data using many fewer test carriers than needed for methods based on simple MPN estimates.   5.2 The stringency in the test is provided by the use of a soil load, the microtopography of the brushed stainless steel carrier surface, and the smaller ratio of test substance to surface area typical for many disinfectant applications. Thus, the test substance being assessed is presented with a reasonable challenge while allowing for efficient recovery of the test organisms from the inoculated carriers. The metal disks in the basic test are also compatible with a wide variety of actives.   5.3 The design of the carriers makes it possible to place onto each a precisely measured volume of the test organism (10 μL) as well as the control fluid or test substance (50 μL).   5.4 The inoculum is placed at the center of each disk whereas the volumes of the test substance covers nearly the entire disk surface, thus virtually eliminating the risk of any organisms remaining unexposed.   5.5 In all tests, other than those against viruses, the addition of 10 mL of an eluent/diluent gives a 1:200 dilution of the test substance immediately at the end of the contact time. While this step in itself may be sufficient to arrest the microbicidal activity of most actives, the test protocol permits the addition of a specific neutralizer to the eluent/diluent, if required. Except for viruses, the membrane filtration step also allows processing of the entire eluate from the test carriers and, therefore, the capture and subsequent detection of even low numbers of viable organisms that may be present. Subsequent rinsing of the membrane filters with saline also reduces the risk of carrying any inhibitory residues over to the recovery medium. Validation of the process of neutralization of the test substance is required by challenge with low numbers of the test organism.   5.6 In tests against viruses, addition of 1 mL of buffer at the end of the contact time achieves a 1:20 dilution of the test substance while keeping the volume of the eluate reasonably small to allow for the titration of most or all of the eluate in cell cultures. Confirmation of neutralization of the test substance is required by challenge of a residual disinfection load with low numbers of infective units of the test virus. Since the virus assay system is indirect, an additional step is required to demonstrate that prior exposure of the appropriate cell line to any residual disinfectant or disinfectant/neutralizer mixture does not interfere with the detection of a low level of virus challenge (See Appendix X1 ).  Note 1:  In 5.5 and 5.6 , volumes of 10 mL and 1 mL are recommended instead of 9.95 mL and 950 μL, respectively, for ease of dispensing the eluent.   5.7 The soil load in this test is a mixture of three types of proteins (high molecular weight proteins, low molecular weight peptides, and mucous material) designed to represent body secretions, excretions, or other extraneous substances that microbicidal chemicals may encounter under field conditions. It is suitable for working with all types of test organisms included here. The components of the soil load are readily available and subject to much less variability than animal sera.   5.8 If distilled water or other diluent is not to be specified on the product label, the diluent for the test substance is assumed to be tap water. Since the quality of tap water varies considerably both geographically and temporally, this test method incorporates the use of water with a specified and documented level of hardness to prepare use-dilutions of test substance that require dilution in water before use. While water with a hardness of at least 300 ppm as CaCO 3 is recommended consult local regulations regarding use of hard water prior to testing.   5.9 The Annex contains a list of those organisms that are often used in assessing the microbicidal activities of disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces or medical devices. Culture conditions for each organism are also included in the Annex. Depending on the label claim(s) desired and the requirements of the target regulatory agency, one or more of the organisms listed may be selected for the testing. If organisms other than those listed are to be used (for example, in the dairy or brewing industries), a clear justification must be provided and details of the culture media and growth conditions must be validated and clearly specified in test reports. Scope  1.1 This test method is designed to evaluate the ability of test substances to inactivate vegetative bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycobacteria, and bacterial spores ( 1- 7 ) on disk carriers of brushed stainless steel that represent hard, nonporous environmental surfaces and medical devices. It is also designed to have survivors that can be compared to the mean of no less than three control carriers to determine if the performance standard has been met. For proper statistical evaluation of the results, the number of viable organisms in the test inoculum should be sufficiently high to take into account both the performance standard and the experimental variations in the results.   1.2 The test protocol does not include any wiping or rubbing action. It is, therefore, not designed for testing wipes.   1.3 This test method should be performed by persons with training in microbiology in facilities designed and equipped for work with infectious agents at the appropriate biosafety level ( 8 ) .   1.4 It is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (GLPs) are required and to follow them where appropriate (40 CFR, Part 160 for EPA submissions and 21 CFR, Part 58 for FDA submissions).   1.5 In this test method, SI units are used for all applications, except for distance in which case inches are used and metric units follow.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

Particle-bound, oxidized, and elemental mercury measurements before and after control devices may be necessary for optimizing and evaluating the mercury removal efficiency of emission control technologies.   5.2 This test method was developed initially for the measurement of mercury in coal-fired power plants and has been extensively validated for that application. Since the introduction of this method, it has been extensively used on other combustion sources such as cement kilns and waste incinerators. With additional procedures given in this standard, it is also applicable to sources having a flue gas composition with high levels of hydrochloric acid, and low levels of sulfur dioxide (Section 16 ). Scope  1.1 This test method applies to the determination of elemental, oxidized, particle-bound, and total mercury emissions from stationary combustion sources.   1.2 This test method is applicable to elemental, oxidized, particle-bound, and total mercury concentrations ranging from approximately 0.5 μg/Nm 3 to 100 μg/Nm 3 .   1.3 This test method describes equipment and procedures for obtaining samples from effluent ducts and stacks, equipment and procedures for laboratory analysis, and procedures for calculating results.   1.4 This test method is applicable to sampling elemental, oxidized, and particle-bound mercury in flue gases of coal-fired stationary sources.

,D7558-09(2024),"Standard Test Method for  Colorimetric/Spectrophotometric Procedure to Quantify Extractable  Chemical Dialkyldithiocarbamate, Thiuram, and Mercaptobenzothiazole  Accelerators in Natural Rubber Latex and Nitrile Gloves","Significance and Use  5.1 Dialkyldithiocarbamates (DTCs), benzothiazoles, and thiurams are often used as vulcanization accelerators in NRL products. Zinc DTC accelerators are added either directly or are formed in situ during the vulcanization process via reaction between a thiuram(s) and zinc oxide. DTCs, benzothiazoles, and thiurams have been detected in leachates from medical devices made of rubber such as gloves. Studies have shown these chemicals can cause allergic contact dermatitis. A simple selective method to monitor rubber accelerator levels in rubber extracts would be useful for quality control, product screening and research.   5.2 This colorimetric assay measures dialkyldithiocarbamates, including zinc dialkyldithiocarbamates (ZDTC), mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and thiurams as a total thiol vulcanization accelerator level in rubber products. A UV spectrophotometer with detection at 320 nm is used to measure the ZDTC, mercaptobenzothiazole and thiurams. Sample extracts diluted at 1:20 prior to measurement on the spectrophotometer is usually sufficient to quantify the residual accelerator level from most commercially available rubber gloves; however, sample dilution can be adjusted (from neat extract to > 1:20 dilution) based on analytical needs. Thiurams and ZDTCs complex with cobalt turning the extract to a concentration-dependent shade of green. ZDTCs reacts quickly while thiurams react very slowly (requiring a heat catalyst). Mercaptobenzothiazole does not complex to Co(III), however, it absorbs strongly at 320 nm. It can be distinguished from both ZDTCs and thiurams by its strong absorbance at 320 nm without the cobalt dependent visible green color. Cobalt complexed thiurams and ZDTCs, but not MBT, also have and absorbance at 370 nm ( 2 ). Scope  1.1 This test method is designed to quantify the amount of total extractable accelerators in natural rubber latex (NRL) and nitrile gloves. Three common classes of rubber accelerators, the mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), thiuram, and thiocarbamate type compounds can be detected and quantified by this method. If the specific rubber accelerator(s) present in the glove material is not known, quantification is based on zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate (ZDBC) equivalents. This method will not detect all potential rubber accelerators, including mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide, dimorpholine, thioureas and diphenyl diamine.   1.2 For the purpose of this test method, the range of chemical accelerator measurement is based on the limit of detection (LOD) established in the performing laboratory.   1.3 This test method should be performed by experienced analysts or under the supervision of those experienced in the use of spectroscopy and working with organic solvents.   1.4 This test method has not been validated for measurement of long chain dithiocarbamates or accelerators from other rubber products, such as lubricated condoms ( 1 ). 2 Although this assay has been reported in the literature for the evaluation of accelerator levels in condoms, further validation for accelerator measurement from other rubber products is required by the testing laboratory prior to use.   1.5 This test method is not designed to evaluate the potential of rubber materials to induce or elicit Type IV skin sensitization reactions (for Type IV skin sensitization reactions see Test Method D6355 ).

,F3263-17,Standard Guide for Packaging Test Method Validation,"Significance and Use   4.1 Addressing consensus standards with inter-laboratory studies (ILS) and methods specific to an organization. Test methods need to be validated in many cases, in order to be able to rely on the results. This has to be done at the organization performing the tests but is also performed in the development of standards in inter-laboratory studies (ILS), which are not substitutes for the validation work to be performed at the organization performing the test.   4.1.1  Validations at the Testing Organization— Validations at the test performing organization include planning, executing, and analyzing the studies. Planning should include description of the scope of the test method which includes the description of the test equipment as well as the measurement range of samples it will be used for, rationales for the choice of samples, the amount of samples as well as rationales for the choice of methodology.   4.1.2  Objective of ILS Studies— ILS studies (per E691 -14) are not focused on the development of test methods but rather with gathering the information needed for a test method precision statement after the development stage has been successfully completed. The data obtained in the interlaboratory study may indicate however, that further effort is needed to improve the test method. Precision in this case is defined as the repeatability and reproducibility of a test method, commonly known as gage R&R. For interlaboratory studies, repeatability deals with the variation associated within one appraiser operating a single test system at one facility whereas reproducibility is concerned with variation between labs each with their own unique test system. It is important to understand that if an ILS is conducted in this manner, reproducibility between appraisers and test systems in the same lab are not assessed.   4.1.3  Overview of the ILS Process— Essentially the ILS process consists of planning, executing, and analyzing studies that are meant to assess the precision of a test method. The steps required to do this from an ASTM perspective are; create a task group, identify an ILS coordinator, create the experimental design, execute the testing, analyze the results, and document the resulting precision statement in the test method. For more detail on how to conduct an ILS refer to E691 -14.   4.1.4  Writing Precision and Bias Statements— When writing Precision and Bias Statements for an ASTM standard, the minimum expectation is that the Standard Practice outlined in E177 -14 will be followed. However, in some cases it may also be useful to present the information in a form that is more easily understood by the user of the standard. Examples can be found in 4.1.5 below.   4.1.5  Alternative Approaches to Analyzing and Stating Results—Variable Data:  4.1.5.1  Capability Study:  (1) A process capability greater than 2.00 indicates the total variability (part-to-part plus test method) of the test output should be very small relative to the tolerance. Mathematically,    (2) Notice, σ Total in the above equation includes σ Part and σ TM . Therefore, two conclusions can be made:  (a) The test method can discriminate at least 1/12 of the tolerance and hence the test method resolution is adequate Therefore, no additional analysis such as a Gage R&R Study is necessary.  (b) The measurement is precise relative to the specification tolerance.  (3) In addition, since the TMV capability study requires involvement of two or more operators utilizing one or more test systems, a high capability number will prove consistent test method performance across operators and test systems.  4.1.5.2  Gage R&R Study:  (1) The proposed acceptance criteria below for %SV, %R&R, and %P/T came from the industry-wide adopted requirements for measurement systems. According to Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Measurement System Analysis Manual (4th edition, p. 78), a test method can be accepted if the test method variation (σ TM ) counts for less than 30 percent of the total variation of the study (σ Total ).  (2) This is equivalent to:A process capability greater than 2.00 indicates the total variability (part-to-part plus test method) of the test output should be very small relative to the tolerance. Mathematically,    (3) When historical data is available to evaluate the variability of the process, we should also have:    (4) For %P/T, another industry-wide accepted practice is to represent the population using the middle 99% of the normal distribution. 5 And ideally, the tolerance range of the output should be wider than this proportion. For a normally distributed population, this indicates:    (5) The factor 5.15 in the above equation is the two-sided 99% Z-score of a normal distribution. Therefore:    (6) In practice this means that a test method with up to 6% P/T reproducibility would be effective at assessing the P/T for a given design.  4.1.5.3  Power and Sample Size Study:  (1) When comparing the means of two or more populations using statistical tests, excessive test method variability may obscure the real difference (“Signal”) and decrease the power of the statistical test. As a result, a large sample size may be needed to maintain an adequate power ( ≥ 80%) for the statistical test. When the sample size becomes too large to accept from a business perspective, one should improve the test method before running the comparative test. Therefore, an accept /reject decision on a comparative test method could be made based on its impact on the power and sample size of the comparative test (ex. 2 Sample T-test).   4.2  Attribute Test Method Validation:   4.2.1  Objective of Attribute Test Method Validation— Attribute test method validation (ATMV) demonstrates that the training and tools provided to inspectors enable them to distinguish between good and bad product with a high degree of success. There are two criteria that are used to measure whether an ATMV has met this objective. The primary criterion is to demonstrate that the maximum escape rate, β, is less than or equal to its prescribed threshold of βmax. The parameter β is also known as Type II error, which is the probability of wrongly accepting a non-conforming device. The secondary criterion is to demonstrate that the maximum false alarm rate, α, is less than or equal to its prescribed threshold of αmax. The parameter α is also known as Type I error, which is the probability of wrongly rejecting a conforming device.   4.2.2  Overview of the ATMV Process— This section describes how an ATMV typically works. In an attribute test method validation, a single, blind study is conducted that is comprised of both conforming and non-conforming units. The ATMV passes when the requirements of the both sampling plans are met. The first sampling plan demonstrates that the test method meets the requirements for the maximum allowable beta error (escape rate), and the second sampling plan demonstrates that the test method meets the requirements for the maximum allowable alpha error (false alarm rate). In other words, the test method is able to demonstrate that it accepts conforming units and rejects non-conforming units with high levels of effectiveness. The beta error sampling plan will consist entirely of nonconforming units. The total number of beta trials conducted by each inspector 6 are pooled together, and their total number of misclassifications (nonconforming units that were accepted) need to be less than or equal to the number of failures prescribed by the beta error sampling plan. The alpha error sampling plan will consist entirely of conforming units. The total number of alpha trials conducted by each inspector are pooled together, and their total number of misclassifications (conforming units that were rejected) need to be less than or equal to the number of failures prescribed by the alpha error sampling plan.   4.2.3  ATMV Examples— Attribute test methods cover a broad range of testing. Examples of these test method categories are listed in Table 1 . The right half of the table consists of test methods that return qualitative responses, and the left half of the table contains test methods that provide variable measurement data.    4.2.4  ATMV for Variable Measurement Data— It is a good practice to analyze variable test methods as variable measurement data whenever possible. However, there are instances where measurement data is more effectively treated as qualitative data. Example: A Sterile Barrier System (SBS) for medical devices with a required seal strength specification of 1.0-1.5 lb./in. is to be validated. A tensile tester is to be used to measure the seal strength, but it only has a resolution of 0.01 lbs. As a result, the Ppk calculations typically fail, even though there is very rarely a seal that is out of specification in production. The validation team determines that the data will need to be treated as attribute, and therefore, an ATMV will be required rather than a variable test method validation.   4.2.5  Self-evident Inspections— This section illustrates the requirements of a self-evident inspection called out in the definitions above. To be considered a self-evident inspection, a defect is both discrete in nature and requires little or no training to detect. The defect cannot satisfy just one or the other requirement.  4.2.5.1 The following may be considered self-evident inspections:  (1) Sensor light illuminates when lubricity level on a wire is correct and otherwise does not light up when lubrication is insufficient – Since the test equipment is creating a binary output for the inspector and the instructions are simple, this qualifies as self-evident. However, note that a test method validation involving the equipment needs to be validated.  (2) Component is present in the assembly – If the presence of the component is reasonably easy to detect, this qualifies as self-evident since the outcome is binary.  (3) The correct component is used in the assembly – As long as the components are distinct from one another, this qualifies as self-evident since the outcome is binary.  4.2.5.2 The following would generally not be considered self-evident inspections:  (1) Burn or heat discoloration – Unless the component completely changes color when overheated, this inspection is going to require the inspector to detect traces of discoloration, which fails to satisfy the discrete conditions requirement.  (2) Improper forming of S-bend or Z-bend – The component is placed on top of a template, and the inspector verifies that the component is entirely within the boundaries of the template. The bend can vary from perfectly shaped to completely out of the boundaries in multiple locations with every level of bend in-between. Therefore, this is not a discrete outcome.  (3) No nicks on the surface of the component – A nick can vary in size from “not visible under magnification” to “not visible to the unaided eye” to “plainly visible to the unaided eye”. Therefore, this is not a discrete outcome.  (4) No burrs on the surface of a component – Inspectors vary in the sensitivity of their touch due to callouses on their fingers, and burrs vary in their degree of sharpness and exposure. Therefore, this is neither a discrete condition nor an easy to train instruction.  (5) Component is cracked – Cracks vary in length and severity, and inspectors vary in their ability to see visual defects. Therefore, this is neither a discrete outcome nor an easy to train instruction.   4.2.6  ATMV Steps:  4.2.6.1  Step 1 – Prepare the test method documentation:  (1) Make sure equipment qualifications have been completed or are at least in the validation plan to be completed prior to executing the ATMV.  (2) Examples of equipment settings to be captured in the test method documentation include environmental or ambient conditions, magnification level on microscopes, lighting and feed rate on automatic inspection systems, pressure on a vacuum decay test and lighting standards in a cleanroom, which might involve taking lux readings in the room to characterize the light level.  (3) Work with training personnel to create pictures of the defects. It may be beneficial to also include pictures of good product and less extreme examples of the defect, since the spectrum of examples will provide better resolution for decision making.  (4) Where possible, the visual design standards should be shown at the same magnification level as will be used during inspection.  (5) Make sure that the ATMV is run using the most recent visual design standards and that they are good representations of the potential defects.  4.2.6.2  Step 2 – Establish acceptance criteria:  (1) Identify which defects need to be included in the test.  (2) Use scrap history to identify the frequency of each defect code or type. This could also be information that is simply provided by the SME.  (3) Do not try to squeeze too many defects into a single inspection step. As more defects are added to an inspection process, inspectors will eventually reach a point where they are unable to check for everything, and this threshold may also show itself in the ATMV testing. Limits will vary by the type of product and test method, but for visual inspection, 15-20 defects may be the maximum number that is attainable.  4.2.6.3  Step 3 – Determine the required performance level of each defect:  (1) If the ATMV testing precedes completion of a risk analysis, the suggested approach is to use a worse-case outcome or high risk designation. This needs to be weighed against the increase in sample size associated with the more conservative rating.  (2) Failure modes that do not have an associated risk index may be tested to whatever requirements are agreed upon by the validation team. If a component or assembly can be scrapped for a particular failure mode, good business sense is to make sure that the inspection is effective by conducting an ATMV.  (3) Pin gages are an example of a variable output that is sometimes treated as attribute data due to poor resolution combined with tight specification limits. In this application, inspectors are trained prior to the testing to understand the level of friction that is acceptable versus unacceptable.  (4) Incoming inspection is another example of where variable data is often treated as attribute. Treating variable measurements as pass/fail outcomes can allow for less complex measurement tools such as templates and require less training for inspectors. However, these benefits should be weighed against the additional samples that may be required and the degree of information lost. For instance, attribute data would say that samples centered between the specification limits are no different than samples just inside of the specification limits. This could result in greater downstream costs and more difficult troubleshooting for yield improvements.  4.2.6.4  Step 4 – Determine acceptance criteria:  (1) Refer to your company’s predefined confidence and reliability requirements; or  (2) Refer to the chart example in Appendix X1 .  4.2.6.5  Step 5 – Create the validation plan:  (1) Determine the proportion of each defect in the sample.  (a) While some sort of rationale should be provided for how the defect proportions are distributed in the ATMV, there is some flexibility in choosing the proportions. Therefore, different strategies may be employed for different products and processes, for example 10 defective parts in 30 or 20 defects in 30. The cost of the samples along with the risk associated with incorrect outcomes affects decision making.  (b) Scrap production data will often not be available for new products. In these instances, use historical scrap from a similar product or estimate the expected scrap proportions based on process challenges that were observed during development. Another option is to represent all of the defects evenly.  4.2.6.6  Step 6 – Determine the number of inspectors and devices needed:  (1) When the number of trials is large, consider employing more than three inspectors to reduce the number of unique parts required for the test. More inspectors can inspect the same parts without adding more parts to achieve additional trials and greater statistical power.  (2) Inspectors are not required to all look at the same samples, although this is probably the simplest approach.  (3) For semi-automated inspection systems that are sensitive to fixture placement or setup by the inspector, multiple inspectors should still be employed for the test.  (4) For automated inspection systems that are completely inspector independent, only one inspector is needed. However, in order to reduce the number of unique parts needed, consider controlling other sources of variation such as various lighting conditions, temperature, humidity, inspection time, day/night shift, and part orientations.  4.2.6.7  Step 7 – Prepare the Inspectors:  (1) Train the inspectors prior to testing:  (a) Explain the purpose and importance of ATMV to the inspectors.  (b) Inspector training should be a two-way process. The validation team should seek feedback from the inspectors on the quality and clarity of visual standards, pictures and written descriptions in the inspection documentation.  (1) Are there any gray areas that need clarification?  (2) Would a diagram be more effective than an actual picture of the defect?  (c) Review borderline samples. Consider adding pictures/diagrams of borderline samples to the visual standards. In some cases there may be a difference between functional and cosmetic defects. This may vary by method/package type.  (d) Some validation teams have performed dry run testing to characterize the current effectiveness of the inspection. Note that the same samples should not be used for dry run testing and final testing if the same inspectors are involved in both tests.  4.2.6.8  Step 8 – Select a representative group of inspectors as the test group:  (1) There will be situations, such as site transfer, where all of the inspectors have about the same level of familiarity with the product. If this is the case, select the test group of inspectors based on other sources of variability within the inspectors, such as their production shift, skill level or years of experience with similar product inspection.  (2) The inspectors selected for testing should at least have familiarity with the product, or this becomes an overly conservative test. For example, a lack of experience with the product may result in an increase in false positives.  (3) Document that a varied group of inspectors were selected for testing.  4.2.6.9  Step 9 – Prepare the Test Samples:  (1) Collect representative units.  (a) Be prepared for ATMV testing by collecting representative defect devices early and often in the development process. Borderline samples are particularly valuable to collect at this time. However, be aware that a sample that cannot even be agreed upon as good or bad by the subject matter experts is only going to cause problems in the testing. Instead, choose samples that are representative of “just passing” and “just failing” relative to the acceptance criteria.  (2) Use the best judgment as to whether the man-made defect samples adequately represent defects that naturally occur during the sealing process, distribution simulation, or other manufacturing processes, for example. If a defect cannot be adequately replicated and/or the occurrence rate is too low to provide a sample for the testing, this may be a situation where the defect type can be omitted with rationale from the testing.  (3) Estimate from a master plan how many defects will be necessary for testing, and try to obtain 1.5 times the estimated number of samples required for testing. This will allow for weeding out broken samples and less desirable samples.  (4) Traceability of samples may not be necessary. The only requirement on samples is that they accurately depict conformance or the intended nonconformance. However, capturing traceability information may be helpful for investigational purposes if there is difficulty validating the method or if it is desirable to track outputs to specific non-conformities.  (5) There should preferably be more than one SME to confirm the status of each sample in the test. Keep in mind that a trainer or production supervisor might also be SMEs on the process defect types.  (6) Select a storage method appropriate for the particular sample. Potential options include tackle boxes with separate labeled compartments, plastic resealable bags and plastic vials. Refer to your standardized test method for pre-conditioning requirements.  (7) Writing a secret code number on each part successfully conceals the type of defect, but it is NOT an effective means of concealing the identity of the part. In other words, if an inspector is able to remember the identification number of a sample and the defect they detected on that sample, then the test has been compromised the second time the inspector is given that sample. If each sample is viewed only once by each inspector, then placing the code number on the sample is not an issue.  (8) Video testing is another option for some manual visual inspections, especially if the defect has the potential to change over time, such as a crack or foreign material.  (9) If the product is extremely long/large, such as a guidewire, guide catheter, pouch, tray, container closure system (jar & lid), and the defects of interest are only in a particular segment of the product, one can choose to detach the pertinent segment from the rest of the sample. If extenuating factors such as length or delicacy is an element in making the full product challenging to inspect, then the full product should be used. Example: leak test where liquid in the package that could impact the test result.  (10) Take pictures or videos of samples with defects and store in a key for future reference.  4.2.6.10  Step 10 – Develop the protocol:  (1) Suggested protocol sections  (a) Purpose and scope.  (b) Reference to the test method document being validated.  (c) A list of references to other related documents, if applicable.  (d) A list of the types of equipment, instruments, fixtures, etc. used for the TMV.  (e) TMV study rationale, including:  (1) Statistical method used for TMV;  (2) Characteristics measured by the test method and the measurement range covered by the TMV;  (3) Description of the test samples and the rationale;  (4) Number of samples, number of operators, and number of trials;  (5) Data analysis method, including any historical statistics that will be used for the data analysis (for example, the historical average for calculating %P/T with a one-sided specification limit).  (f) TMV acceptance criteria.  (g) Validation test procedures (for example, sample preparation, test environment setup, test order, data collection method, etc.).  (h) Methods of randomization  (1) There are multiple ways to randomize the order of the samples. In all cases, store the randomized order in another column, then repeat and append the second randomized list to the first stored list for each sample that is being inspected a second time by the same inspector.  (2) Consider using Excel, Minitab, or an online random number generator to create the run order for the test.  (3) Draw numbers from a container until the container is empty and record the order.  (i) Some companies apply time limits to each sample or a total time limit for the test so that the testing is more representative of the fast-paced requirements of the production environment. If used, this should be noted in the protocol.  4.2.6.11  Step 11 – Execute the protocol:  (1) Be sure to comply with the pre-conditioning requirements during protocol execution.  (2) Avoid situations where the inspector is hurrying to complete the testing. Estimate how long each inspector will take and plan ahead to start each test with enough time in the shift for the inspector to complete their section, or communicate that the inspector will be allowed to go for lunch or break during the test.  (3) Explain to the inspector which inspection steps are being tested. Clarify whether there may be more than one defect per sample. However, note that more than one defect on a sample can create confusion during the testing.  (4) If the first person fails to correctly identify the presence or absence of a defect, it is a business/team decision on whether to continue the protocol with the remaining inspectors. Completing the protocol will help characterize whether the issues are widespread, which could help avoid failing again the next time. On the other hand, aborting the ATMV right away could save considerable time for everyone.  (5) It is not good practice to change the sampling plan during the test if a failure occurs. 7 For instance, if the original beta error sampling plan was n=45, a=0, and a failure occurs, updating the sampling plan to an n = 76, a=1 during the test is incorrect since the sampling plan being performed is actually a double sampling plan with n1=45, a1=0, r1=2, n2=31, a1=1. This results in an LTPD = 5.8%, rather than the 5.0% LTPD in the original plan.  (6) Be prepared with replacement samples in reserve if a defect sample becomes damaged.  (7) Running the test concurrently with all of the test inspectors is risky, since the administrator will be responsible for keeping track of which inspector has each unlabeled sample.  (8) Review misclassified samples after each inspector to determine whether the inspector might have detected a defect that the prep team missed.  4.2.6.12  Step 12 – Analyze the test results:  (1) Scrapping for the wrong defect code or defect type:  (a) There will be instances where an inspector describes a defect with a word that wasn’t included in the protocol. The validation team needs to determine whether the word used is synonymous with any of the listed names for this particular defect. If not, then the trial fails. If the word matches the defect, then note the exception in the deviations section of the report.  (2) Excluding data from calculations of performance:  (a) If a defect is discovered after the test is complete, there are two suggested options. First, the inspector may be tested on a replacement part later if necessary. Alternatively, if the results of the individual trial will not alter the final result of the sampling plan, then the replacement trials can be bypassed. This rationale should be documented in the deviations section of the report.  (1) As an example, consider an alpha sampling plan of n = 160, a = 13 that is designed to meet a 12% alpha error rate. After all inspectors had completed the test, it was determined that one of the conforming samples had a defect, and five of the six trials on this sample identified this defect, while one of the six called this a conforming sample. The results of the six trials need to be scratched, but do they need to be repeated? If the remaining 154 conforming trials have few enough failures to still meet the required alpha error rate of 12%, then no replacement trials are necessary. The same rationale would also apply to a defective sample in a beta error sampling plan.  (2) If a vacuum decay test sample should have failed the leak test, in that case as part of the protocol the process may be to send the sample back to the company that created the defective sample for confirmation that it is indeed still defective. If found to no longer be representative of the desired defect type, then the sample would be excluded from the calculations.  4.2.6.13  Step 13 – Complete the validation report:  (1) When the validation test passes:  (a) If the ATMV was difficult to pass or it requires special inspector training, consider adding an appraiser proficiency test to limit those who are eligible for the process inspection.  (2) When the validation test fails:  (a) Repeating the validation  (1) There is no restriction on how many times an ATMV can fail. However, some common sense should be applied, as a high number of attempts appear to be a test-until-you-pass approach and could become an audit flag. Therefore, a good rule of thumb is to perform a dry run or feasibility assessment prior to execution to optimize appraiser training and test methodology in order to reduce the risk of failing the protocol. If an ATMV fails, members of the validation team could take the test themselves. If the validation team passes, then something isn’t being communicated clearly to the inspectors, and additional interviews are needed to identify the confusion. If the validation team also fails the ATMV, this is a strong indication that the visual inspection or attribute test method is not ready for release.  (b) User Error  (1) Examples of ATMV test error include:  (a) Microscope set at the wrong magnification.  (b) Sample traceability compromised during the ATMV due to a sample mix-up.  (2) A test failure demonstrates that the variability among inspectors needs to be reduced. The key is to understand why the test failed, correct the issue and document rationale, so that subsequent tests do not appear to be a test-until-you-pass approach.  (3) As much as possible, the same samples should not be used for the subsequent ATMV if the same inspectors are being tested that were in the previous ATMV.  (4) Interview any inspectors who committed classification errors to understand if their errors were due to a misunderstanding of the acceptance criteria or simply a miss.  (5) To improve the proficiency of defect detection/test methodology the following are some suggested best practices:  (a) Define an order of inspection in the work instruction for the inspectors, such as moving from proximal end to distal end or doing inside then outside.  (b) When inspecting multiple locations on a component or assembly for specific attributes, provide a visual template with ordered numbers to follow during the inspection.  (c) Transfer the microscope picture to a video screen for easier viewing.  (d) If there are too many defect types to look for at one inspection step, some may get missed. Move any inspections not associated with the process back upstream to the process that would have created the defect.  (6) When an inspector has misunderstood the criteria, the need is to better differentiate good and nonconforming product. Here are some ideas:  (a) Review the visual standard of the defect with the inspectors and trainers.  (b) Determine whether a diagram might be more informative than a photo.  (c) Change the magnification level on the microscope.  (d) If an ATMV is failing because borderline defects are being wrongly accepted, slide the manufacturing acceptance criteria threshold to a more conservative level. This will potentially increase the alpha error rate, which typically has a higher error rate allowance anyway, but the beta error rate should decrease.  (7) Consider using an attribute agreement analysis to help identify the root cause of the ATMV failure as it is a good tool to assess the agreement of nominal or ordinal ratings given by multiple appraisers. The analysis will calculate both the repeatability of each individual appraiser and the reproducibility between appraisers, similar to a variable gage R&R.  4.2.6.14  Step 14 – Post-Validation Activities:  (1) Test Method Changes  (a) If requirements, standards, or test methods change, the impact of the other two factors needs to be assessed.  (b) As an example, many attribute test methods such as visual inspection have no impact on the form, fit or function of the device being tested. Therefore, it is easy to overlook that changes to the test method criteria documented in design prints, visual design standards, visual process standards need to be closely evaluated for what impact the change might have on the performance of the device.  (c) A good practice is to bring together representatives from operations and design to review the proposed change and consider potential outcomes of the change.  (d) For example, changes to the initial visual inspection standards that were used during design verification builds may not identify defects prior to going through the process of distribution simulation. Stresses that were missed during this initial inspection may be exacerbated by exposure to shock, vibration, thermal cycling associated with the distribution simulation process.

Specifically, the guide may:   4.1.1 Help educate new users of laboratory informatics;   4.1.2 Help educate general audiences in laboratories and other organizations that use laboratory informatics;   4.1.3 Help educate instrument manufactures and producers of other commonly interfaced systems;   4.1.4 Provide standard terminology that can be used by laboratory informatics vendors and end users;   4.1.5 Establish a minimum set of requirements for primary laboratory informatics functions;   4.1.6 Provide guidance on the tasks performed and documentation created in the specification, evaluation, cost justification, implementation, project management, training, and documentation of laboratory informatics; and   4.1.7 Provide high-level guidance for the integration of laboratory informatics and other software tools.   4.2  How to be Used— This guide is intended to be used by all stakeholders involved in any aspect of laboratory informatics implementation, use, or maintenance.   4.2.1 It is intended to be used throughout the laboratory informatics life cycle by individuals or groups responsible for laboratory informatics implementation and use, including specification, build/configuration, validation, use, upgrades, and retirement/decommissioning.   4.2.2 This guide also provides an example of a laboratory informatics functional requirements checklist that can be used to guide the purchase, upgrade, or development of a laboratory informatics system. Scope   1.1 This guide helps describe the laboratory informatics landscape and covers issues commonly encountered at all stages in the life cycle of laboratory informatics from inception to retirement. It explains the evolution of laboratory informatics tools used in today’s laboratories such as laboratory information management systems (LIMS), laboratory execution systems (LES), laboratory information systems (LIS), electronic laboratory notebooks (ELN), scientific data management systems (SDMS), and chromatography data systems (CDS). It also covers the relationship (interactions) between these tools and the external systems in a given organization. The guide discusses supporting laboratory informatics tools and a wide variety of the issues commonly encountered at different stages in the life cycle. The subsections that follow describe the scope of this document in specific areas.   1.2  High-Level Purpose— The purpose of this guide includes: (1) educating new users on laboratory informatics tools; (2) providing a standard terminology that can be used by different vendors and end users; (3) establishing minimum requirements for laboratory informatics; (4) providing guidance for the specification, evaluation, cost justification, implementation, project management, training, and documentation of the systems; and (5) providing a functional requirements checklist for laboratory informatics systems that can be adopted within the laboratory and integrated with existing systems.   1.3  Laboratory Informatics Definition— Laboratory informatics is the specialized application of information technology aimed at optimizing laboratory operations. It is a collection of informatics tools utilized within laboratory environments to collect, store, process, analyze, report, and archive data and information from the laboratory and its supporting processes. Laboratory informatics includes the effective use of critical data management systems, the electronic delivery of results to customers, and the use and integration of supporting systems (for example, training and policy management). Examples of primary laboratory informatics tools include laboratory information management systems (LIMS), laboratory execution systems (LES), laboratory information systems (LIS), electronic laboratory notebooks (ELN), scientific data management systems (SDMS), and chromatography data systems (CDS).   1.4  Scope Considerations when Selecting and Implementing Laboratory Informatics Solutions— Many laboratories have determined that they need to deploy multiple laboratory informatics systems to automate their laboratory processes and manage their data. Selection of an informatics solution requires a detailed analysis of the laboratory’s requirements and should not be a simple product category decision. Information technology (IT) representatives and subject matter experts (SMEs) who understand the needs of the laboratory need to be involved in the selection and implementation of a laboratory informatics system to ensure that the needs of the laboratory are met and IT can support it. Customers (internal and external) of laboratory information should also be included in the laboratory informatics solution design to ensure full electronic integration between systems.   1.5 The scope of this guide covers a wide range of laboratory types, industries, and sizes. Examples of laboratory types and industries include:   1.5.1  General Laboratories:  1.5.1.1 Standards (ASTM, IEEE, ISO) and  1.5.1.2 Government (EPA, FDA, JPL, NASA, NRC, USDA, USGS, FERC).   1.5.2  Environmental:  1.5.2.1 Environmental monitoring.   1.5.3  Life Science Laboratories:  1.5.3.1 Biotechnology and  1.5.3.2 Diagnostic.   1.5.4  Healthcare and Medical:  1.5.4.1 Bionomics/genomics,  1.5.4.2 Medical devices,  1.5.4.3 Pharmaceutical,  1.5.4.4 Veterinary,  1.5.4.5 Public health, and  1.5.4.6 Hospital.   1.5.5  Heavy Industry Laboratories:  1.5.5.1 Energy and resources,  1.5.5.2 Manufacturing and construction,  1.5.5.3 Materials and chemicals, and  1.5.5.4 Transportation and shipping.   1.5.6  Food and Beverage Laboratories:  1.5.6.1 Agriculture,  1.5.6.2 Beverages,  1.5.6.3 Food, and  1.5.6.4 Food service and hospitality.   1.5.7  Public Sector Laboratories:  1.5.7.1 Law enforcement/forensic,  1.5.7.2 State and local government,  1.5.7.3 Education and nonprofits, and  1.5.7.4 Public utilities (water, electric, waste treatment).   1.6  Integration— The scope of integration covered in this guide includes communication and meaningful data exchange between different laboratory informatics tools and other external systems (document management, chromatography data systems, laboratory instruments, spectroscopy data systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP), manufacturing execution systems (MES), investigations/deviations and CAPA management systems), and other integrated business systems (for example, clinical or hospital environments) provide significant business benefits to any laboratory and is discussed at a high level in this guide.   1.7  Life-Cycle Phases— The scope of this guide is intended to provide an understanding of laboratory informatics tools’ life cycle from project initiation point to retirement and decommissioning. This guide was designed to help newer audiences in understanding the complexity in the relationships between different laboratory informatics tools and how to plan and manage the implementation project, while seasoned users may use the different life cycles to maintain existing laboratory informatics tools. Integrating additional informatics tools to existing ones in today’s evolving laboratory environment adds constraints that need to be considered. The life-cycle discussion includes both the laboratory informatics solution life cycle as well as the project life cycle.   1.7.1 The product life cycle encompasses a specific laboratory informatics system and the expected useful life of that system before it needs to be replaced or upgraded.   1.7.2 The project life cycle encompasses the activities to acquire, implement, operate, and eventually retire a specific laboratory informatics system.   1.8  Audience— This guide has been created with the needs of the following stakeholders in mind: (1) end users of laboratory informatics tools, (2) implementers of laboratory informatics tools, (3) quality personnel, (4) information technology personnel, (5) laboratory informatics tools vendors, (6) instrument vendors, (7) individuals who approve laboratory informatics tools funding, (8) laboratory informatics applications support specialists, and (9) software test/validation specialists. Information contained in this guide will benefit a broad audience of people who work in or interact with a laboratory. New users can use this guide to understand the purpose and functions of the wide variety of laboratory informatics tools as well as the interactions between these tools with external systems. The guide can also help prospective users in understanding terminology, configurations, features, design, benefits, and costs of these different laboratory informatics tools. Individuals who are purchasing specific tools may also use this guide to identify functions that are recommended for specific laboratory environments. Research and development staff of different commercial laboratory informatics systems vendors may use the guide as a tool to evaluate, identify, and potentially improve the capabilities of their products. The vendors’ sales staff may use the guide to represent functions of their laboratory informatics products to prospective customers in more generic and product-neutral terms.   1.9  Out of Scope— This guide does not attempt to define the boundaries of laboratory informatics, as they continue to evolve and blur between the different types of tools; rather, it focuses on the functionality that is provided by laboratory informatics as a whole.   1.10  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E3219-20,Standard Guide for Derivation of Health-Based Exposure Limits (HBELs),"Significance and Use  4.1 Guidelines for unintended human exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are required by various global regulations as part of international quality requirements, needed as good product stewardship, and are considered the industry standard.   4.2 Application of the approach described within this guide applies a scientifically justified, data-driven, approach to deriving safe limits for unintended exposures to individual substances. These limits can then be further used to calculate cleaning limits used in quality risk assessment for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The HBEL approach considers substance-specific properties (type of effect, potency, pharmacology, safety profile, and so forth). Specific approaches are applicable to different categories of substances and in specific stages in drug development.   4.3 The basis for the HBEL derivation is all available substance-specific data. Interpretation of these data considers the quantity and robustness of the database and the reliability and relevance of the data. Typically, adjustment factors (AFs) are used to address variability and uncertainty in different parameters to determine a safe human exposure limit, although alternative, purposefully conservative, approaches [for example, threshold of toxicological concern (TTC), read-across] may be used as appropriate.   4.4 This guide supports, and is consistent with, elements of the European Commission (EU) Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use ( 27 , 28 ) and guidance from the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineers (ISPE) ( 29 ) in which it is mentioned that relevant residue limits should be based on a toxicological evaluation.   4.5  Key Concepts— This guide applies the following steps: ( 1 ) hazard characterization, ( 2 ) identification of the critical effect(s) including dose-response assessment, ( 3 ) determination of one or several points of departure (PoD)s, ( 4 ) application of PoD-specific AFs, and ( 5 ) calculation of HBELs including justification of selected HBEL ( 18 ) (see Fig. 1 ).  FIG. 1 Process Underlying the Calculation and Final Selection of an HBEL  Note 1:  This figure represents an example where three possible PoDs have been selected based on three distinctive critical effects, followed by PoD-specific application of AFs and calculation of three HBELs. Scope  1.1 This guide describes the scientific procedures underlying the integrative interpretation of all data concerning an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) taking into account study adequacy, relevance, reliability, validity, and compound-specific characteristics (for example, potency, toxicological profile, and pharmacokinetics) leading to a numerical value for the API, which is used further in the quality risk management (ICH Q9) of cross contamination during the manufacture of different products in the same manufacturing facilities.   1.2 This guide describes general guidance for calculating and documenting a health-based exposure limit (HBEL). It should serve the involved qualified experts as a reference for HBEL derivations and should harmonize the different approaches and nomenclature to the greatest extent possible.   1.3 This guide should be used for calculating and documenting an HBEL, when required or necessary, for APIs (including biologics), intermediates, cleaning agents, excipients, and other chemicals (that is, reagents, manufacturing residues, and so forth) used for cleaning validation and verification (Guides F3127 and E3106 ). In scope is the cleaning and cross contamination of surfaces of manufacturing equipment and medical devices but does not include leachables/extractables (21 CFR 211.67, 21 CFR 610.11, 21 CFR 820.70, and 21 CFR 111.27).   1.4 The principles in this guide may also be used as a basis for setting occupational exposure limits.   1.5 The principles in this guide may be applied during the development and commercial manufacturing of small or large molecular weight medicines as well as isolated pharmaceutical intermediates.   1.6 Subsequent-product HBEL values may be set for specific routes of exposure (for example, oral, inhalation, and parenteral) when necessary (for example, because of differences in bioavailability) and for specific patient populations (for example, children) if formulations are manufactured in which one daily dose is not for the 50 kg standard adult but the dosage form is adjusted to a target population with a lower body weight.   1.7 The primary scope of this guide is to ensure the safety of human patients exposed to residual active substances and intermediates via medicinal products. The general principles of this guide can also be applied to the manufacture of veterinary medicinal products. However, there may be certain unique toxicological and pharmacological species-specific differences, such as metabolism and sensitivity, as well as assumptions such as body weight for veterinary medicines that are not addressed in this guide.   1.8 This guide may be used independently or in conjunction with other proposed E55 standards published by ASTM International.   1.9  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.10  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.11  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,G194-08(2018),Standard Test Method for  Measuring Rolling Friction Characteristics of a Spherical Shape  on a Flat Horizontal Plane,"Significance and Use   5.1 Rolling friction like sliding friction depends upon many factors. It is a system effect that involves the nature of the rolling surface and the counterface. The sliding friction force ( F ) is usually considered to be the sum of forces arising from deformations of surface features ( F s ), from attractive forces (atomic, molecular, etc.) at contact points ( F a ) and force from interaction of films and particulates on the rubbing surfaces ( F f ):  The rolling friction force includes these force contributions plus effects from the relative stiffness of the contacting surfaces, the diameter (curvature) of the spherical shape (ball, orange, etc.) and other factors. Because there are so many factors involved in a rolling tribosystem, rolling resistance can best be quantified by an actual test of the sphere of interest on the intended counterface, as in this test method.   5.2 There are countless applications where it is important to quantify the rolling characteristics of a particular spherical shape on a particular surface. The interlaboratory tests conducted for this test method were performed on hardened steel balls like those used in ball bearings. This test method could be used to assess the effect of different counterface surfaces on the rolling characteristics of balls for ball bearings. Conversely, it could be used as a quality control test on balls. Surface imperfections/defects/films, etc. on the balls can affect how they roll: the distance traveled on a common counterface.   5.3 Industrial applications of this test method can include assessing conveying surfaces for spherical or nearly special parts: check valve balls, cabinet knobs, Christmas ornaments, toilet floats, etc. Many medical devices use special shapes where rolling characteristics are a consideration. Similarly, many pharmaceutical products (pills) are spherical or nearly spherical in shape, and this test method can be used to assess rolling characteristics for conveying or other reasons such as size (mass) check.   5.4 Rolling friction of spherical shapes can be a consideration in countless sports (soccer, golf, lacrosse, etc.) and game applications (billiards, bocce, toys, etc.). This test method can be used to rank the rolling resistance of different ball compositions, masses, shapes, surface textures, design, stiffness, etc. Similarly, the test method can be used to assess the ease of rolling of balls on different playing or game surfaces.   5.5 This test method is very applicable to spherical or mostly spherical food products. For example, it is common to use rolling distance of apples, citrus, nuts, etc. to classify them by size for marketing. They are rolled down an angled surface and the rolling distance becomes a function of size (mass/diameter). This test method can be used to assess the suitability of various rolling surfaces (carpet, metal, wood, etc.) for suitability in classification equipment. It could also be used for food conveyance on spherical-shaped processed foods (gumballs, hard candy, meatballs, etc.)   5.6 Finally, this test method can be a valuable teaching tool for physics and tribology students. The equipment is simple, low cost and student proof. It can be used to demonstrate the concept of rolling friction and the factors that affect it. Scope   1.1 This test method covers the use of an angled launch ramp to initiate rolling of a sphere or nearly spherical shape on a flat horizontal surface to determine the rolling friction characteristics of a given spherical shape on a given surface.   1.1.1 Steel balls on a surface plate were used in interlaboratory tests (see Appendix X1 ). Golf balls on a green, soccer and lacrosse balls on playing surfaces, bowling balls on an a lane, basketballs on hardwood, and marbles on composite surface were tested in the development of this test method, but the test applies to any sphere rolling on any flat horizontal surface.   1.1.2 The rolling friction of spheres on horizontal surfaces is affected by the spherical shape’s stiffness, radius of curvature, surface texture, films on the surface, the nature of the counterface surface; there are many factors to consider. This test method takes all of these factors into consideration. The spherical shape of interest is rolled on the surface of interest using a standard ramp to initiate rolling and standard techniques to measure and treat the rolled distance after leaving the ramp.   1.1.3 This test method produces a rolling resistance number on a specific spherical shape on a specific surface. It is intended for comparing similar tribosystems. For example, the rolling resistances of marbles on a particular surface are not to be compared with the rolling resistance of soccer balls on grass, because their masses and diameters are very different as are the counterface surfaces on which they roll.   1.1.4 Different launch ramps are appropriate for different types of spherical shapes. If a sphere of interest cannot be accommodated with using one of the launch ramps discussed in Appendix X1 and Appendix X2 , a different launch ramp can be developed and added with future revisions to this test method.   1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.4  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,D8320-21,Standard Practice for Implementing an Information Security Program in a Cannabis  Operation,"Significance and Use  5.1 Information security programs and controls should be implemented by all cannabis businesses to protect information assets, which include information system infrastructure, architecture, analog (paper) and electronic data, files and records.   5.2 The cannabis industry is in transition from an unregulated industry to a regulated industry, which involves substantial investment. Implementing an information security program helps organizations manage information security threats and protect the organization, employees, customers, vendors and other business partners from unauthorized access, misuse of information, crime, and costly exposure or loss.   5.3 Cannabis customers and business partners place higher value on keeping information secure and have heightened concerns about information security due to the legal complexities and stigma around the industry.   5.4 Information systems have multiple access points that present opportunities for vulnerabilities, such as user accounts, removable storage devices, internet connections, malicious malware and other attacks, scams, and poorly guided access controls.   5.5 This practice intends to help organizations of all types and sizes find an acceptable balance of risks and costs of threat mitigation, recovery and remediation.   5.6 When planning an information security program, a broad range of input from all departments (or functional areas), levels of staff, and areas of expertise (information technology, legal, compliance, human resources, tax/accounting) is ideal for identifying the highest information security risks to the organization and can make implementation go more smoothly.   5.7 Information assets must be protected throughout the entire lifecycle (creation, transmission, review, storage, and destruction).   5.8  Users of This Practice:   5.8.1 This practice is written for cannabis business operations to be used by:  5.8.1.1 Business owners and management to develop security controls to prevent, detect, and mitigate vulnerabilities and risk, enhance business planning, and respond to and recover from incidents;  5.8.1.2 Consultants to provide guidance about information security assessments, analysis, controls and information audits;  5.8.1.3 Authorities having jurisdiction to inspect the adequacy of information security; and  5.8.1.4 Training organizations and certification bodies to train or certify individuals on the body of knowledge related to information security in the cannabis industry.   5.9  Iterative Implementation Approach:   5.9.1 Implementing an information security program is not a one-time sequence of tasks. Once an Information security program manager is assigned, team participants are educated, risk assessments and analyses are conducted, iterative cycles of implementing controls can begin. Initial plans will focus on higher priority assets and risks and easy to implement controls. Teams will monitor implementation, make adjustments, and repeat as needed.   5.9.2 An information security audit should be conducted at least once a year.  5.9.2.1 Audits can be assigned to internal or external auditors, depending on need for objectivity, independent review, or in accordance with legal mandates.   5.10  Unique Business Entities:   5.10.1 This practice is not a one-size-fits-all model to manage cybersecurity risk. Since each operation's risks, systems, procedures, digital usage, size, and scale are unique, the use of this practice requires ongoing engagement and continuous evaluation of prevention and countermeasures to stay abreast of ever-changing threats. This practice cannot be used by itself as an information security policy, procedure, or program; each entity must develop and monitor its own information security practice. This practice will guide the planning, assessment, implementation, audit, and improvement of an ongoing information security program.   5.11  Compliance and Legal Considerations:   5.11.1 Cannabis business mandates are complex and unique to each jurisdiction. Cannabis businesses must consult with legal, compliance, accounting, security, human resources and information technology professionals for guidance about protecting and sharing records.   5.11.2 Multiple levels of jurisdiction can apply (local, state/province, country) and mandates can conflict rendering them unclear. For example, legal experts do not agree on whether U.S. HIPAA laws apply to cannabis businesses that sell to medical patients.   5.11.3 Since remediation efforts are costly, all cannabis business entities must maintain an active information security program to prevent and detect threats with plans to respond and recover from incidents.   5.11.4 Business entities should not rely solely on purchased software vendors for advice, because none can manage all the information security and related compliance, legal and business risks a cannabis business will face.   5.11.5 Businesses should ensure that intellectual property and other business records, operational records, and customer records are considered and protected in consultation with legal and compliance professionals.   5.12  Insurance, Contracts, and Tax Considerations:   5.12.1 Cannabis business entities should review insurance policies and contracts to ensure adequate protections.   5.12.2 Businesses should consider including elements such as nondisclosure, privacy and confidentiality, data breach protocols, testing and maintenance requirements, scope of work and functional requirements, using proprietary software, uptime, and clear measures of success in contracts.   5.12.3 Cannabis businesses should ensure finance, budget, and tax professionals are consulted about information security plans to ensure team activities and controls are clearly written and implemented in alignment with those goals. Scope  1.1 This practice covers recommendations for implementing an information security program to protect businesses operating in the regulated cannabis industry. An information security program is part of an overall security program that each business should implement.   1.2 This practice applies to any legal business entity that handles cannabis products, including cultivation, processing, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, lab testing, distribution, retail, home delivery, and waste. This practice will include protections for analog (paper) and digital information assets.   1.3 Actual implementation will vary depending on organizational size and type, information asset types, sensitivity and volume of assets, risk tolerance and resource constraints of the organization, and mandates particular to the organization.   1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.5  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F2149-16,Standard Test Method for Automated Analyses of Cells—the Electrical Sensing Zone  Method of Enumerating and Sizing Single Cell Suspensions,"Significance and Use  3.1 The electrical sensing zone method for cell counting is used in tissue culture, government research, and hospital, biomedical, and pharmaceutical laboratories for counting and sizing cells. The method may be applicable to a wide range of cells sizes and cell types, with appropriate validation ( 10 ) .   3.2 The electrical sensing zone methodology was introduced in the mid-1950s ( 9 ) . Since this time, there have been substantial improvements which have enhanced the operator's ease of use. Among these are the elimination of the mercury manometer, reduced size, greater automation, and availability of comprehensive statistical computer programs.   3.3 This instrumentation offers a rapid result as contrasted to the manual counting of cells using the hemocytometer standard counting chamber. The counting chamber is known to have an error of 10 to 30 %, as well as being time-consuming ( 11 ) . In addition, when counting and sizing porcine hepatocytes, Stegemann et al concluded that the automated, electrical sensing zone method provided greater accuracy, precision, and speed, for both counts and size, compared to the conventional microscopic or the cell mass-based method ( 7 ) . Scope  1.1 This test method, provided the limitations are understood, covers a procedure for both the enumeration and measurement of size distribution of most all cell types. The instrumentation allows for user-selectable cell size settings and is applicable to a wide range of cell types. The method works best for spherical cells, and may be less accurate if cells are not spherical, such as for discoid cells or budding yeast. The method is appropriate for suspension as well as adherent cell cultures ( 1 ) . 2 Results may be reported as number of cells per milliliter or total number of cells per volume of cell suspension analyzed. Size distribution may be expressed in cell diameter or volume.   1.2 Cells commonly used in tissue-engineered medical products ( 2 ) are analyzed routinely. Examples are chondrocytes ( 3 ) , fibroblasts ( 4 ) , and keratinocytes ( 5 ) . Szabo et al. used the method for both pancreatic islet number and volume measurements ( 6 ) . In addition, instrumentation using the electrical sensing zone technology was used for both count and size distribution analyses of porcine hepatocytes placed into hollow fiber cartridge extracorporeal liver assist systems. In this study ( 7 ) , and others ( 6 , 8 ) , the automated electrical sensing zone method was validated for precision when compared to the conventional visual cell counting under a microscope using a hemocytometer. Currently, it is not possible to validate cell counting devices for accuracy, since there not a way to produce a reference sample that has a known number of cells. The electrical sensing zone method shall be validated each time it is implemented in a new laboratory, it is used on a new cell type, or the cell counting procedure is modified.   1.3 Electrical sensing zone instrumentation (commonly referred to as a Coulter counter) is manufactured by a variety of companies and is based upon electrical impedance. This test method, for cell counting and sizing, is based on the detection and measurement of changes in electrical resistance produced by a cell, suspended in a conductive liquid, traversing through a small aperture (see Fig. 1 ( 9 ) ). When cells are suspended in a conductive liquid, phosphate-buffered saline for instance, they function as discrete insulators. When the cell suspension is drawn through a small cylindrical aperture, the passage of each cell changes the impedance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes located on each side of the aperture. An electrical pulse, suitable for both counting and sizing, results from the passage of each cell through the aperture. The path through the aperture, in which the cell is detected, is known as the “electronic sensing zone.” This test method permits the selective counting of cells within narrow size distribution ranges by electronic selection of the generated pulses. While the number of pulses indicates cell count, the amplitude of the electrical pulse produced depends on the cell's volume. The baseline resistance between the electrodes is due to the resistance of the conductive liquid within the boundaries of the aperture. The presence of cells within the “electronic sensing zone” raises the resistance of the conductive pathway that depends on the volume of the cell. Analyses of the behavior of cells within the aperture demonstrates that the height of the pulse produced by the cell is the parameter that most nearly shows proportionality to the cell volume.   1.4 Limitations are discussed as follows:   1.4.1  Coincidence— Occasionally, more than a single cell transverses the aperture simultaneously. Only a single larger pulse, as opposed to two individual pulses, is generated. The result is a lower cell count and higher cell volume measurement. The frequency of coincidence is a statistically predictable function of cell concentration that is corrected by the instrument. This is called coincidence correction ( 8 ) . This phenomenon may be reduced by using lower cell concentrations.   1.4.2  Viability— Electrical sensing zone cell counting enumerates both viable and nonviable cells and cannot determine percent viable cells. A separate test, such as Trypan blue, is required to determine percent viable cells.   1.4.3  Cell Diameter— This is a function of the size range capability of the aperture size selected. Measurements may be made in the cell diameter range of 0.6 μm to 1200 μm. Setting the counting size range on the instrument can affect the test results, especially if the cell size has a large distribution, and should be carefully controlled to help achieve repeatability.   1.4.4  Size Range of the Aperture— The size range for a single aperture is proportional to its diameter. The response has been found to depend linearly on diameter over a range from 2 % to 80 % of the diameter. However, the aperture tube may become prone to blockage at levels greater than 60 % of diameter. Therefore, the practical operating range of the aperture is considered to be 2 % to 60 % of the diameter.   1.4.5  Humidity— 10 % to 85 %.   1.4.6  Temperature— 10 °C to 35 °C.   1.4.7  Electrolyte Solution— The diluent for cell suspension shall provide conductivity and have minimal effect on cell size. The electrolyte of choice is commonly phosphate-buffered saline. ",https://www.astm.org/F2149-16.html,
,E2663-23,Standard Practice for  Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation  (DICONDE) for Ultrasonic Test Methods,"Significance and Use  5.1 Personnel that are responsible for the creation, transfer, and storage of ultrasonic test results will use this standard. This practice defines a set of information modules that, along with Practice E2339 and the DICOM standard, provides a standard means to organize ultrasonic test parameters and results. The ultrasonic test results may be displayed and analyzed on any device that conforms to this standard. Personnel wishing to view any ultrasonic inspection data stored in DICONDE format may use this document to help them decode and display the data contained in the DICONDE compliant inspection record. Scope  1.1 This practice covers the interoperability of ultrasonic imaging equipment by specifying image data transfer and archival storage methods in commonly accepted terms. This document is intended to be used in conjunction with Practice E2339 . Practice E2339 defines an industrial adaptation of NEMA PS3 / ISO 12052 (DICOM, see http://medical.nema.org), an international standard for image data acquisition, review, transfer, and archival storage. The goal of Practice E2339 , commonly referred to as DICONDE, is to provide a standard that facilitates the display and analysis of NDE test results on any system conforming to the DICONDE standard. Toward that end, Practice E2339 provides a data dictionary and set of information modules that are applicable to all NDE modalities.

,F2577-22,Standard Guide for  Compositional Evaluation of Declarable Substances and Substances  of Concern for Materials in Products,"Significance and Use  4.1 Regulations, standards, and market-defined requirements for chemical constituent (“substances of interest”) compliance and conformance have become increasing numerous and complex. Specific laws and standards may pertain to certain product and industry segments, for example, electrical/electronic instruments and components, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer products, agrichemicals, and so forth. Others may be broader and relate specifically to assessment and management of specific chemical compounds or classes across multiple product sectors and sources, for example Ref ( 2 ) . In addition, such requirements may be issued by national authorities, international standards setting groups, or, in the case of market-defined requirements, even by customer advocacy organizations or customers through supply contracts. The resulting global landscape of requirements and market access expectations is complex, and compliance/conformance presents numerous challenges for manufacturers.  Note 1:  For example, IEC 62474:2012 provides some standardized definitions for reporting thresholds and declaration statements for electrotechnical industry. In another example, ISO 14021:2016 addresses self-declared environmental claims.   4.2 Declarable substances may be found on various lists and forms, including those listed in Refs ( 2- 10 ) and on supply agreements and questionnaires. This guide is not intended to be exhaustive nor cover all declarable substances. Nor does this guide address specific declaration and labeling requirements within these regulation and standards nor address product safety and compliance requirements as dictated by law for specific products, industries, or market regions.   4.3 In addition to new laws and standards, more chemical substances are continually added to a variety of screening lists for review of potential hazards, identification and quantification of possible health or environmental hazards, or both, and consideration of control measures. To comply with these requirements, significant efforts are being directed to detailed data gathering throughout manufacturer supply chains, documentation of presence or absence of such declarable substances, and continual “update” maintenance of the resultant information. Standardized processes have been proposed to assess the potential for a material to contain a possible substance of interest/concern.   4.4 Because of requirements being placed on concentrations of declarable substances within (or on) materials, assessing conformance of products has become a complex, time-consuming, and expensive task. This guide is intended to assist the user in developing a protocol for product assessment. This guide is also directed toward interpretation and communication of the resultant information, specifically where clear objective/numeric data are not available or obtainable, and in the absence of directly applicable regulatory direction. This guide is intended to harmonize language used to interpret and communicate results of these formulation-based or direct-analysis based assessments. Examples include “not expected to contain,” “not intentionally added,” “not used in formulation,” “below de minimis levels,” “below analytical detection limits,” “not toxicologically significant,” “not material to safety,” “free of,” and so forth.   4.5  A priori knowledge is based on logical deduction and scientific principles, so actual testing of a material may not be required to assess conformance to requirements. For example, it is possible to deduce that organic substances will not survive the temperatures required to produce wrought steel, so there is no need to test for organic substances in wrought steel nor is it possible to develop test methods and reference materials for determination of organic substances within wrought steel.   4.6  A posteriori knowledge is based on observation, experience and known facts. If a priori knowledge cannot rule out the possibility that a substance is present within (or on) a material, a test method may be required to verify or generate information on the concentration of that substance within (or on) the material.   4.7 Statements provided by a manufacturer about declarable substances in a product may contain either or both a priori and a posteriori information. The recipient of such statements may be downstream manufacturers who incorporate multiple materials and components into other products with their own subsequent documentation on declarable substances. Each producer is responsible for its own products’ substance declarations, including any potential inaccuracies that may be provided by suppliers. Thus, each manufacturer should take into account its suppliers’ risk profiles when choosing to rely on supplier declarations.   4.8 Test methods can be used to verify and provide information related to substances within materials. At the same time, misinformation can be generated or inappropriate conclusions drawn when test methods are misapplied. This guide is intended to provide recommendations on the application of test methods.   4.9 Test methods may be applied by producers or by interim or end users of materials. However, it is not necessary or cost effective to test materials at each stage of production. The decision to apply test methods and the frequency of testing should be based on risk perceived by the user or can be a matter of agreement.   4.10 Assessment of different types and classes of materials each have their individual complexities and nuances given the advancements in both materials and analytical evaluation methods.   4.11 For some regulations and directives, a clear de minimis threshold has been defined for a substance or group of substances. In the absence of a prescribed de minimis , 0.1 % (w/w) is a suitable threshold.   4.11.1 The de minimis level may be described as an individual limit, or as an aggregated limit, whose details will be dependent on a specific regulation. In no instance shall an aggregated de minimis exceed the sum of the prescribed de minimis for the collective group of substances.   4.12 This guide includes a general process and case studies in order to provide guidance and to distinguish when a priori and a posteriori knowledge should be applied. Flow charts as a guide for assessment of materials and products are provided in Appendix X1 . Scope  1.1 This guide uses case studies to illustrate the decision process to assess materials and products for declarable substances when evaluating conformance to relevant requirements. This may be accomplished by applying existing knowledge to determine the need for further action (for example, testing).   1.2 This guide assists in utilization and interpretation of various forms of information gathered to enable compliance or conformance or both to regulations, standards, supply agreements, or customer enquiries related to identified declarable substances, including the evidence required to issue declarations for the absence or presence of a declarable substance. Several examples are referenced. The target declarable substances will be specific to the product and product classification, the regulatory jurisdiction, customer/supplier requirements, and other relevant considerations. Consideration of which regulations and standards apply to a given product is beyond the scope of this guide.   1.3 The framework covered in this guide attempts to harmonize language used in the absence of objective data or specific regulatory requirements or both. This guide draws on a variety of existing documentation, which will be cited and referenced, as well as basic scientific principles for communication of chemical hazard and risk, and may be used as an approach for assessing composition of products and their components as part of product risk assessment.   1.4 This guide is applicable to a variety of materials, including polymeric and elastomeric materials, which are used in regulated industries and products.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.6  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E2339-21,Standard Practice for  Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation  (DICONDE),"Significance and Use  5.1 Personnel that are responsible for the transfer of NDE data between systems will use this standard. This practice will define a set of NDE information object definitions that along with the DICOM standard will provide a standard means to organize image data. Once conformance statements have been generated, the NDE image data may be displayed on any imaging/analysis device that conforms to the standard. This process of developing conformance statements with both the NDE specific object definitions and the DICOM accepted definitions, will provide a means to automatically and transparently communicate between compliant equipment without loss of information.  Note 1:  Knowledge and understanding of the existing DICOM standard will be required to generate conformance statements and thereby facilitate the data transfer. Scope  1.1 This practice facilitates the interoperability of NDE imaging and data acquisition equipment by specifying the image data in commonly accepted terms. This practice represents a harmonization of NDE imaging systems, or modalities, with the NEMA Standards Publication titled Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM, see http://medical.nema.org), an international standard for image data acquisition, review, storage and archival. In addition, this practice will provide a standard set of industrial NDE specific information object definitions, which travel beyond the scope of standard DICOM modalities. The goal of this practice is to provide a standard by which NDE image/signal data may be displayed on by any system conforming to the ASTM DICONDE format, regardless of which NDE modality was used to acquire the data.   1.2 This practice has been developed to overcome the issues that arise when archiving or analyzing the data from a variety of NDE techniques, each using proprietary data acquisition systems. As data acquisition modalities evolve, data acquired in the past must remain decipherable. This practice proposes an image data file format in such a way that all the technique parameters, along with the image file, are preserved, regardless of changes in NDE technology. This practice will also permit the viewing of a variety of image types (CT, CR, Ultrasonic, Infrared, and Eddy Current) on a single workstation, maintaining all of the pertinent technique parameters along with the image file. This practice addresses the exchange of digital information between NDE imaging equipment.   1.3 This practice does not specify:   1.3.1 A complete description of all the information necessary to implement the DICONDE standard for an imaging modality. This document must be used in conjunction with one of the method-specific DICONDE Standard Practice documents and the DICOM Standard to completely describe all the requirements necessary to implement the DICONDE standard for an imaging modality. See 2.1 of this document for a current list of the method-specific standard practice documents.   1.3.2 A testing or validation procedure to assess an implementation's conformance to the standard. Best practices for demonstrating conformance can be found in Practice E3147 .   1.3.3 The implementation details of any features of the standard on a device claiming conformance.   1.3.4 The overall set of features and functions to be expected from a system implemented by integrating a group of devices each claiming DICONDE or DICOM conformance.   1.4  Units— Although this practice contains no values that require units, it does describe methods to store and communicate data that do require units to be properly interpreted.

,D2983-23,"Standard Test Method for  Low-Temperature Viscosity of Automatic Transmission Fluids,  Hydraulic Fluids, and Lubricants using a Rotational Viscometer","Significance and Use  5.1 The low-temperature, low-shear-rate viscosity of automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, torque and tractor fluids, and industrial and automotive hydraulic oils (see Appendix X4 ) are of considerable importance to the proper operation of many mechanical devices. Measurement of the viscometric properties of these oils and fluids at low temperatures is often used to specify their acceptance for service. This test method is used in a number of specifications.   5.2 Initially this test method was developed to determine whether an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) would meet OEM low temperature performance criterion originally defined using a particular model viscometer. 6, 7 The viscosity range covered in the original ATF performance correlation studies was from less than 1000 mPa·s to more than 60 000 mPa·s. The success of the ATF correlation and the development of this test method has over time been applied to other fluids and lubricants such as gear oils, hydraulic fluids, and so forth.   5.3 Procedures A, B, C, and D of this test method describe how to measure apparent viscosity directly without the errors associated with earlier techniques that extrapolated experimental viscometric data obtained at higher temperatures.  Note 1:  Low temperature viscosity values obtained by either interpolation or extrapolation of oils may be subject to errors caused by gelation and other forms of non-Newtonian response to spindle speed and torque.   5.4 Procedures A, B, C, and D; If viscosity measurements are difficult to stabilize or a noticeable decrease in viscosity is seen at a constant speed between an initial measurement made during the 5 s to 10 s after the spindle rotation commences and the stabilized measurement between 60 s and 180 s, then this most likely indicates time-dependent, structural breakdown in the fluid. Some formulated fluid types may form wax structures when soaked at or below a certain low temperature which varies among fluids. The rotating spindle of the viscometer can degrade this structure over time, resulting in a decrease in the apparent viscosity at longer measurement times. This can obscure a higher initial viscosity. It is possible that this high initial viscosity may be detrimental to certain machinery, as historically seen in some automatic transmissions. It was the reason for developing this test. 6, 7 It is recommended, that if this phenomenon is observed, the suitability of this fluid for the application is carefully considered. If desired, Test Method D5133 or Test Method D6821 may be used to study the behavior of these fluids. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the use of rotational viscometers with an appropriate torque range and specific spindle for the determination of the low-shear-rate viscosity of automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, hydraulic fluids, and some lubricants. This test method covers the viscosity range of 300 mPa·s to 900 000 mPa·s   1.2 This test method was previously titled “Low-Temperature Viscosity of Lubricants Measured by Brookfield Viscometer.” In the lubricant industry, D2983 test results have often been referred to as “Brookfield 2 Viscosity” which implies a viscosity determined by this method.   1.3 This test method contains four procedures: Procedure A is used when only an air bath is used to cool samples in preparation for viscosity measurement. Procedure B is used when a mechanically refrigerated programmable liquid bath is used to cool samples in preparation for viscosity measurement. Procedure C is used when a mechanically refrigerated constant temperature liquid bath is used to cool samples by means of a simulated air cell (SimAir) 3 Cell in preparation for viscosity measurement. Procedure D automates the determination of low temperature, low-shear-rate viscosity by utilizing a thermoelectrically heated and cooled temperature-controlled sample chamber along with a programmable rotational viscometer.   1.4 There are multiple precision studies for this test method.   1.4.1 The viscosity data used for the precision studies for Procedures A, B, and C covered a range from 300 mPa·s to 170 000 mPa·s at test temperatures of –12 °C, –26 °C, and –40 °C. Appendix X5 includes precision data for –55 °C test temperature and includes samples with viscosities greater 500 000 mPa·s.   1.4.2 The viscosity data used for Procedure D precision study was from 6400 mPa·s to 256 000 mPa·s at test temperatures of –26 °C and –40 °C.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.5.1 The test method uses the SI unit, milliPascal-second (mPa·s), as the unit of viscosity. (1 cP = 1 mPa·s).   1.6  WARNING —Mercury has been designated by many regulatory agencies as a hazardous substance that can cause serious medical issues. Mercury, or its vapor, has been demonstrated to be hazardous to health and corrosive to materials. Use Caution when handling mercury and mercury-containing products. See the applicable product Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for additional information. The potential exists that selling mercury or mercury-containing products, or both, is prohibited by local or national law.

It is also intended to serve as a standard guide for the preparation of more specific documents with values and limits covering specific end uses.   1.3 Compliance with these criteria shall not be construed as an endorsement of implantability. The biocompatibility of epoxy plastics as a class has not been established. Epoxy plastic is a generic term relating to the class of polymers formed from epoxy resins, certain curing agents or catalysts, and various additives. Since many compositions and formulations fall under this class, it is essential that the formulator or fabricator ensure biocompatibility of the specific composition or formulation in its intended end use. Since these criteria provide guidance for the preparation of more specific documents covering specific end uses, these documents will provide bases for standardized evaluation of biocompatibility appropriate for a specific end use.   1.4 Each of the properties listed shall be considered in selecting materials for specific end uses. A list of selected properties with limiting values assigned is suggested for separate product specifications.   1.5 All of the properties and test methods listed may not be pertinent in any specific situation, nor may all of the tests outlined be required.   1.6 These criteria are limited to functionally or fully cured epoxy plastics.

,F3375-19,Standard Test Method for Assessing Non-Metered Restricted Delivery Systems for Liquid  Consumer Products,"Significance and Use   5.1 Despite child-resistant packaging requirements for most potentially harmful liquid consumer products, each year tens of thousands of young children are evaluated in emergency departments for potential poisoning from liquid consumer products. Products that use reclosable safety packaging rely on users to resecure the child-resistant closure fully after each use. If the closure is not fully secured or a child opens the closure, the entirety of the product contents is immediately accessible. Restricted delivery systems are a type of packaging for medications and other liquid consumer products designed to limit the amount of product that is accessible even after the primary closure is removed.   5.2 This test method can be used to provide quantitative assessment of restricted delivery systems for liquid consumer products. This test method outlines three types of mechanical test procedures to simulate methods young children may use when attempting to access liquid contents from a container. To evaluate the efficacy of restricted delivery systems, tests are conducted with the primary closure removed and under conditions approximating intended use of the products. Instruction for use for the intended product should be used when preparing the samples for testing; for example, storage temperature, shaking of product, and use of associated dispensing devices when applicable. Scope   1.1 This test method covers assessment of non-metered restricted delivery system characteristics so that they can be evaluated to a standard that signifies efficacy in limiting accessibility of liquid contents to young children.   1.2 This test method provides general test conditions for the determination of flow control of liquids by restricted delivery systems using mechanical testing to simulate methods that may be used to access liquid consumer products by young children.   1.3 The test parameters provided within this test method are estimates based on existing literature and experience. The estimated values are intended to allow comparison of performance characteristics across different restricted delivery systems.   1.4 This test method applies to liquids packaged in reclosable containers.  Note 1:  Since there are many variables that may affect release of liquid (for example, rigidity of container, viscosity of liquid contents, or variation in test equipment), it is important that the entire restricted delivery system is tested together as intended for use while using the same or similar testing equipment. This test method does not address other product characteristics that might be affected by use of restricted delivery systems (for example, uniformity of active ingredient throughout duration of use).   1.5  Units— The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. Combining values from the two systems may result in nonconformance with the standard.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E2537-16,Standard Guide for  Application of Continuous Process Verification to Pharmaceutical  and Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing,"Significance and Use  4.1 Application of the approach described within this standard guide applies science-based concepts and principles introduced in the FDA’s initiative on pharmaceutical CGMPs for the 21st century. 4    4.2 This guide supports, and is consistent with, elements from ICH Q8 – Q11 and guidelines from USFDA, European Commission, Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme, and the China Food and Drug Administration. 8   4.3 According to FDA Guidance for Industry, PAT, “With real time quality assurance, the desired quality attributes are ensured through continuous assessment during manufacture. Data from production batches can serve to validate the process and reflect the total system design concept, essentially supporting validation with each manufacturing batch.” In other words, the accumulated product and process understanding used to identify the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), together with the control strategy, will enable control of the CQAs, providing the confidence needed to show validation with each batch. This is as opposed to a traditional discrete process validation approach. Scope  1.1 This guide describes Continuous Process Verification as an alternate approach to process validation where manufacturing process (or supporting utility system) performance is continuously monitored, evaluated, and adjusted (as necessary). It is a science-based approach to verify that a process is capable and will consistently produce product meeting its predetermined critical quality attributes. Continuous Process Verification (ICH Q8) is similarly described as Continuous Quality Verification.   1.2 Pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical product manufacturing companies are required to provide assurance that the processes used to manufacture regulated products result in products with the specified critical quality attributes of strength identity and purity associated with the product safety and efficacy. Process validation is a way in which companies provide that assurance.   1.3 With the knowledge obtained during the product lifecycle, a framework for continuous quality improvements will be established where the following may be possible: (1) risk identified, (2) risk mitigated, (3) process variability reduced, (4) process capability enhanced, (5) process design space defined or enhanced, and ultimately (6) product quality improved. This can enable a number of benefits that address both compliance and operational goals (for example, real time release, continuous process improvement).   1.4 The principles in this guide may be applied to drug product or active pharmaceutical ingredient/drug substance pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical batch or continuous manufacturing processes or supporting utility systems (for example, TOC for purified water and water for injection systems, and so forth).   1.5 The principles in this guide may be applied during the development and manufacturing of a new process or product or for the improvement or redesign, or both, of an existing process.   1.6 Continuous process verification may be applied to manufacturing processes that use monitoring systems that provide frequent and objective measurement of process data in real time. These processes may or may not employ in-, on-, or at-line analyzers/controllers that monitor, measure, analyze, and control the process performance. The associated processes may or may not have a design space.   1.7 This guide may be used independently or in conjunction with other proposed E55 standards to be published by ASTM International.

,E2656-16,Standard Practice for  Real-time Release Testing of Pharmaceutical Water for the Total  Organic Carbon Attribute,"Significance and Use  5.1 Pharmaceutical water is the most common component or ingredient used in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Acceptable purity of the water is important to the quality of the final pharmaceutical product. TOC concentration is a key indicator and attribute of the purity of this water and also an important monitor of the overall performance of the water purification system. TOC analysis is the measurement of all the covalently bound carbon present in the water, not including carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), bicarbonate icon (HCO 3 – ), or carbonate ion (CO 3 2– ), and is reported as the mass of organic carbon per volume.   5.2 Application of this practice provides pertinent information to make informed decisions on the release of water meeting pharmaceutical TOC concentration specifications. Scope  1.1 This practice establishes an approach to the real-time release testing (RTRT) of pharmaceutical water based on the total organic carbon (TOC) attribute using on-line total organic carbon (OLTOC) instrumentation that is in agreement with current regulatory thinking.   1.2 This practice is harmonized with or supports the concepts of relevant ASTM International Committee E55 on Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products standards, ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines, the U.S. FDA PAT Guidance, and U.S. FDA Pharmaceutical cGMPs.   1.3 This practice does not provide general guidance information for pharmaceutical procedures that are considered standard practice in the pharmaceutical industry. This practice provides specific guidance for non-standardized procedures.   1.4 This practice does not address the user’s various internal procedures for risk, change, or quality management systems. The overall project effort associated with this practice shall be proportional to the overall risk of failing the pharmaceutical water’s TOC concentration specification.   1.5 This practice does not purport to establish how to comply with pharmacopeias. The RTRT methodology selected must assure compliance with the user’s current required pharmacopeias. However, compliance with pharmacopeia TOC methods is not necessarily sufficient to meet current regulatory expectations for RTRT.   1.6 This practice does not purport to substitute for or replace compendial bioburden testing requirements. It is strictly applicable to the TOC attribute of water quality.   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

High (detailed) level process understanding can be used to facilitate production of product which consistently meets required specifications. It can also play a key role in continual process improvement efforts.   1.2 Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is one element that can be used for achieving control over those inputs determined to be critical to a process. It is important for the reader to recognize that PAT is defined as:     “…a system for designing, analyzing, and controlling manufacturing through timely measurements (i.e., during processing) of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in process materials and processes, with the goal of ensuring final product quality. It is important to note that the term analytical in PAT is viewed broadly to include chemical, physical, microbiological, mathematical, and risk analysis conducted in an integrated manner.

,E2891-20,Standard Guide for Multivariate Data Analysis in Pharmaceutical Development and  Manufacturing Applications,"Significance and Use  4.1 A significant amount of data is generated during pharmaceutical development and manufacturing activities. The interpretation of such data is becoming increasingly difficult. Individual examination of the univariate process variables is relevant but can be significantly complemented by multivariate data analysis (MVDA). MVDA may be particularly appropriate for exploring and handling large sets of heterogenous data, mapping data of high dimensionality onto lower dimensional representations, exposing significant correlations among multivariate variables within a single data set or significant correlations among multivariate variables across data sets. MVDA may extract statistically significant information which may enhance process understanding, decision making in process development, process monitoring and control (including product release), product life-cycle management, and continuous improvement.   4.2 MVDA is widely used in various industries including the pharmaceutical industry. To achieve a valid outcome, an MVDA model/application should incorporate the following:   4.2.1 A predefined risk-based objective incorporating one or more relevant scientific hypotheses specific to the application;   4.2.2 Sufficient relevant data of requisite quality covering the variance space encountered during intended use, that is, pharmaceutical development, or pharmaceutical manufacturing, or both;   4.2.3 Appropriate data analysis and model utilization practices including considerations on testing, validation, and qualification of all new data prior to using a model to analyze it;   4.2.4 Appropriately trained staff;   4.2.5 Appropriate standard operating procedures; and   4.2.6 Life-cycle management.   4.3 This guide can be used to support data analysis activities associated with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing, process performance and product quality monitoring in manufacturing, as well as for troubleshooting and investigation events. Technical details in data analysis can be found in the scientific literature and standard practices in data analysis are already available (such as Practices E1655 and E1790 for spectroscopic applications, Practice E2617 for model validation, and Practice E2474 for utilizing process analytical technology). Scope  1.1 This guide covers the applications of multivariate data analysis (MVDA) to support pharmaceutical development and manufacturing activities. MVDA is one of the key enablers for process understanding and decision making in pharmaceutical development, and for the release of intermediate and final products after being validated appropriately using a science and risk-based approach.   1.2 The scope of this guide is to provide general guidelines on the application of MVDA in the pharmaceutical industry. While MVDA refers to typical empirical data analysis, the scope is limited to providing a high level guidance and not intended to provide application-specific data analysis procedures. This guide provides considerations on the following aspects:   1.2.1 Use of a risk-based approach (understanding the objective requirements and assessing the fit-for-use status);   1.2.2 Considerations on the data collection and diagnostics used for MVDA (including data preprocessing and outliers);   1.2.3 Considerations on the different types of data analysis, model testing, and validation;   1.2.4 Qualified and competent personnel; and   1.2.5 Life-cycle management of MVDA model.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E2968-23,Standard Guide for Application of Continuous Manufacturing (CM) in the Pharmaceutical  Industry,"Significance and Use  4.1 Although some CM is used in the pharmaceutical industry (for example, purified water production), and some processes are inherently continuous individual unit operations (such as dry granulation and compression), these operations are generally operated in isolation and do not deliver the potential benefits of an integrated CM operation. The FDA Guidance for Industry PAT document specifically identifies that the introduction of continuous processing (now redefined as CM) may be one of the outcomes from the adoption of a science-based approach to process design.   4.2 This guide does not:   4.2.1 Suggest that CM is suitable for the manufacture of all pharmaceutical products.   4.2.2 Provide guidance on issues related to the safe operation of a CM process or continuous processing equipment. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate health and safety practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   4.2.3 Recommend particular designs or operating regimes for CM.   4.3  Appendix X1 includes a table comparing the characteristics of continuous and discrete or batch processes. Scope  1.1 This guide introduces key concepts and principles to assist in the appropriate selection, development and operation of CM technologies for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Athough selected concepts covered here can be applied to biopharmaceutical CM (BioCM), the focus of this guide is on non-biopharmaceutical applications.   1.2 Particular consideration is given to the development and application of the appropriate scientific understanding and engineering principles that differentiate CM from traditional batch manufacturing.   1.3 Most of the underlying concepts and principles (for example, process dynamics and process control) outlined in this guide can be applied to both Drug Substance (DS) and Drug Product (DP) processes. However, it should be recognized that in Drug Substance production the emphasis may be more on chemical behavior and dynamics in a fluid phase whereas for solid drug product manufacture there may be a greater emphasis on the physical behavior and dynamics in a solid/powder format.   1.4 This guide is also intended to apply in both the development of new processes, or the redesign of existing ones.   1.5 All values are stated in SI units.

Temperature and pressure are both critical variables affecting heat transfer, mass transfer, process efficiency, and product quality. For this reason, particular emphasis is placed on product temperature and pressure measurement within the freeze dryer. The methods discussed in this guide are limited to techniques that are equally applicable at both laboratory and production scale.   3.2 Finally, it is recognized that “best practice” changes over time as new technology matures and process understanding deepens. Scope  1.1 Recommended best practices in monitoring of product status during pharmaceutical freeze drying are presented focusing on methods that apply to both laboratory and production scale.   1.2 With respect to product temperature measurement, sources of uncertainty associated with any type of measurement probe are discussed, as well as important differences between the two most common types of temperature-measuring instruments ― thermocouples and resistance temperature detectors (RTD). Two types of pressure transducers are discussed ― thermal conductivity type gauges and capacitance manometers, with the Pirani gauge being the thermal conductivity type gauge of choice. It is recommended that both types of pressure gauge be used on both the product chamber and the condenser for freeze dryers with an external condenser, and the reasoning for this recommendation is discussed.   1.3 Aseptic filling and sterilization practices are outside the scope of this practice.

,D7709-12(2023),Standard Test Methods for  Measuring Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) of Pharmaceutical  Bottles and Blisters,"Significance and Use  5.1 The purpose of these test methods is to obtain reliable values for WVTR that can be used to discriminate among barrier packages for pharmaceutical products. These test methods will establish a WVTR value that represents the water vapor transmission of the container closure system being evaluated. They are intended for use in evaluating or comparing, or both, the water vapor barrier performance of alternative packages for use in packaging of pharmaceutical products.   5.2 While these methods were developed for a specific, limited application, they should be suitable for most types and sizes of consumer packages. Scope  1.1 The three test methods described herein are for measurement of water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) of high-barrier multiple-unit containers (bottles), high-barrier single-unit containers (blisters), and quasi-barrier single-unit containers used for packaging pharmaceutical products. The containers are tested closed and sealed. These test methods can be used for all consumer-sized primary containers and bulk primary containers of a size limited only by the dimensions of the equipment and the weighing capacity and sensitivity of the balance.   1.2 These test methods are intended to be of sufficient sensitivity and precision to allow clear discrimination among the levels of barrier packages currently available for pharmaceutical products.   1.3 There are three methods: Method A is for bottles, Method B is for formed barrier blisters, and Method C is for formed quasi-barrier blisters. Methods B and C can be adapted for use with flexible pouches.   1.4 These test methods use gravimetric measurement to determine the rate of weight gain as a result of water vapor transmission into the package and subsequent uptake by a desiccant enclosed within the package. The packages are exposed to environments typical of those used for accelerated stability testing of drug products in the package (typically 40 °C/75 % relative humidity [RH]).   1.5 For these methods, balance sensitivity, amount of desiccant, number of blisters per test unit, and weighing frequency were developed in an experiment based on Test Methods E96/E96M .   1.6 Test Methods E96/E96M gives specific instruction on the interactions among weighing frequency, number of data points necessary to establish steady state, minimum weight gain in a weighing period, and balance sensitivity.   1.7 The test methods in this standard were developed specifically for pharmaceutical bottles and blisters as closed container-closure systems. The experiment from which the methods were developed provided an inter-laboratory study from which the precision and bias statement was written. The packages in the study were small bottles and blisters used regularly for pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms.   1.8 In spite of the specific nature of their application, the test methods in this standard should be suitable for other pharmaceutical packages and most types and sizes of other consumer packages.   1.9 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.

,D5997-15(2024),"Standard Test Method for  On-Line Monitoring of Total Carbon, Inorganic Carbon in Water   by Ultraviolet,  Persulfate Oxidation, and Membrane Conductivity  Detection","Significance and Use  5.1 This test method is useful for detecting and determining organic and inorganic carbon impurities in water from a variety of sources including industrial water, drinking water, and waste water.   5.2 Measurement of these impurities is of vital importance to the operation of various industries such as power, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, drinking water treatment, and waste treatment. Semiconductor and power applications require measurement of very low organic carbon levels (TOC < 1 μg/L). Applications in pharmaceutical industries range from USP purified water (TOC < 500 μg/L) to cleaning applications (500 μg/L < TOC < 50 000 μg/L). Drinking waters range from <100 μg/L to 25 000 μg/L and higher. Some of these applications may include waters with substantial ionic impurities as well as organic matter.   5.3 Measurement of inorganic carbon as well as total organic carbon is highly important to some applications, such as in the power industry.   5.4 Continuous monitoring and observation of trends in these measurements are of interest in indicating the need for equipment adjustment or correction of water purification procedures.   5.5 Refer to the Bibliography section for additional information regarding the significance of this test method. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the on-line determination of total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC), and total organic carbon (TOC) in water in the range from 0.5 μg/L to 50 000 μg/L of carbon. Higher carbon levels may be determined by suitable on-line dilution. This test method utilizes ultraviolet-persulfate oxidation of organic carbon coupled with a CO 2 selective membrane to recover the CO 2 into deionized water. The change in conductivity of the deionized water is measured and related to carbon concentration in the oxidized sample using calibration data. Inorganic carbon is determined in a similar manner without the requirement for oxidation. In both cases, the sample is acidified to facilitate CO 2 recovery through the membrane. The relationship between the conductivity measurement and carbon concentration can be described by a set of chemometric equations for the chemical equilibrium of CO 2 , HCO 3 − , H + , and OH − , and the relationship between the ionic concentrations and the conductivity. The chemometric model includes the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants and the specific conductances resulting in linear response of the method over the stated range of TOC. See Test Method D4519 for a discussion of the measurement of CO 2 by conductivity.   1.2 This test method has the advantage of a very high sensitivity detector that allows very low detection levels on relatively small volumes of sample. Also, the use of two measurement channels allows determination of IC in the sample independently of organic carbon. Isolation of the conductivity detector from the sample by the CO 2 selective membrane results in a very stable calibration with minimal interferences.   1.3 This test method was used successfully with reagent water spiked with sodium carbonate and various organic compounds. This test method is effective with both deionized water samples and samples of high ionic strength. It is the user's responsibility to ensure the validity of this test method for waters of untested matrices.   1.4 This test method is applicable only to carbonaceous matter in the sample that can be introduced into the reaction zone. The inlet system generally limits the maximum size of particles that can be introduced. Filtration may also be used to remove particles, however, this may result in removal of organic carbon if the particles contain organic carbon.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

This test method may also be used for any product that requires accurate internal package temperature readings while being exposed to a range of external air temperatures.   4.2 Certain items, such as biological materials, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and blood products, must be shipped inside temperature-controlled packages. Factors affecting the rate of heat transfer of the package include the insulation of the exterior package, the energy source, and the product payload.   4.3 Because of the variety of factors affecting the performance of a thermally insulated package, testing should be conducted with the actual package whenever possible. When simulated packages are used, special care must be exercised so that the simulated payload and coolant will be as close as possible to the actual packages in temperature and other relevant physical properties.

This test method permits the measurement of key performance capabilities of CEDI devices using a standard set of conditions. The data obtained can be analyzed to provide information on whether changes may have occurred in operating characteristics of the device independently of any variability in feed water characteristics or operating conditions. Under specific circumstances, this test method may also provide sufficient information for plant design. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of the operating characteristics of continuous electrodeionization (CEDI) devices, indicative of deionization performance when a device is applied to production of highly deionized water from the product water of a reverse osmosis system. This test method is a procedure applicable to feed waters containing carbonic acid or dissolved silica, or both, and other solutes, with a conductivity range of approximately 2 to 100 microsiemens-cm -1 .   1.2 This test method covers the determination of operating characteristics under standard test conditions of CEDI devices where the electrically active transfer media therein is predominantly regenerated.   1.3 This test method is not necessarily indicative of:   1.3.1 Long term performance on feed waters containing foulants or sparingly soluble solutes, or both;   1.3.2 Performance on feeds of brackish water, sea water, or other high salinity feeds;   1.3.3 Performance on synthetic industrial feed solutions, pharmaceuticals, or process solutions of foods and beverages; or   1.3.4 Performance on feed waters less than 2 μS/cm, particularly performance relating to organic solutes, colloidal or particulate matter, or biological or microbial matter.   1.4 This test method, subject to the limitations described, can be applied as either an aid to predict expected deionization performance for a given feed water quality, or as a method to determine whether performance of a given device has changed over some period of time.

,D5090-20,Standard Practice for  Standardizing Ultrafiltration Permeate Flow Performance Data,"Significance and Use  5.1 During the operation of a UF system, conditions including pressure and temperature can vary, causing permeate flow to change (see Note 1 ). To effectively evaluate system performance, it is necessary to compare permeate flow data at the same conditions. Since data may not always be obtained at the same conditions, it is necessary to convert the UF data obtained at actual conditions to a set of constant conditions, thereby standardizing the data. The user of this practice determines the standard conditions. This practice gives the procedure to standardize UF data on pure water only.  Note 1:  Feed concentration, crossflow velocity, and both device and total system recovery will also influence permeate rate, especially when operating on other than pure water. This practice does not address those system conditions.   5.2 This practice can be used for systems which contain spiral-wound, tubular, plate and frame, and hollow fiber devices.   5.3 This practice can be used for a single-element or a multi-element system. However, if the UF system is staged, standardize the permeate flow and salt passage for each stage separately. This requires pressure readings at the feed inlet and concentrate outlet of each stage.   5.4 This practice is applicable for UF systems with no significant leaks between the feed/concentrate and permeate streams.   5.5 This practice assumes no significant osmotic pressure differential (Δπ) exists in the UF system under the actual operating conditions. Differential osmotic pressure will reduce the permeate rate relative to operation on pure water.   5.6 The user of this practice should be aware that fouled UF devices will produce less permeate flow than nonfouled devices, and may wish to perform flushing, chemical, or mechanical cleaning, or combination thereof, prior to determining the permeate flow performance of the device. Scope  1.1 This practice covers the standardization of permeate flow for ultrafiltration (UF) systems.   1.2 This practice is applicable to natural waters including brackish waters, seawaters, and ultrapure waters including those used in power generation and microelectronics and pharmaceuticals production. It is not necessarily applicable to waste waters.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E1909-24,Standard Guide for  Time-Intensity Evaluation of Sensory Attributes,"Significance and Use  5.1 The purpose of time-intensity measurements is to establish the pattern of development and decline of a particular sensory characteristic over time. TI evaluations are applicable when measurements at a single time point (an averaging process) are not sufficient to distinguish products that have very different temporal characteristics.   5.2 TI has applications for a variety of products. Examples include: food products, ranging from short-term sweetness in a beverage to long-term elasticity in chewing gum; personal care products, measuring the development and longevity of shampoo lather and the residual skin feel of a skin cream; household care products, monitoring the intensity of scents over time; pharmaceuticals, monitoring skin cooling after application of a topical analgesic. Auditory signals or visual changes in products can also be evaluated by the TI technique. Scope  1.1 This guide covers procedures for conducting and analyzing time-intensity (TI) evaluations of products or other sensory stimuli. Time-intensity is the measurement of the intensity of a single sensory sensation over time in response to a single exposure to a product or other sensory stimulus. Simultaneous evaluations of multiple sensory attributes are possible, although are outside of the scope of this document. See Reference List for more information.   1.2 This guide utilizes a specially trained panel to measure the intensity of a single continuous sensation during the time from initial exposure:   1.2.1 To its extinction,   1.2.2 To a specified intensity, or   1.2.3 To a predetermined limit of time.   1.3 Applications not covered in this guide include measuring:   1.3.1 Multiple sensations,   1.3.2 Multiple exposures within a single measurement, and   1.3.3 Qualitative or hedonic changes in the perceived sensation.   1.4 This guide includes protocols for the selection and training of judges, descriptions and use of physical data collection devices, and methods of data handling, summarization, and statistical analysis.

,E2299-13(2021),Standard Guide for  Sensory Evaluation of Products by Children and Minors,"Significance and Use  4.1 It is necessary and useful to test with children because they represent the real end-users for many products. Some products are developed specifically for children, and some are dual-purpose products that are intended for adults and children. Examples include: baby foods, diapers, ready-to-eat cereal, juices, food or lunch kits, candy, toys, vitamins and other pharmaceuticals, music and videos, interactive learning tools, and packaging.   4.2 Children have influence over adults' purchase decisions and are responsible for many or some of their own purchase decisions.   4.3 Creating a product for children requires input from children because their wants and needs differ from those of adults. For example, they may differ from adults in preferences or sensory acuity, or both, for sweetness, saltiness, carbonation, and texture. It is impossible to predict the nature of these differences without actual input from the intended target audience. Scope  1.1 This guide provides a framework for understanding the issues relating to conducting sensory and market research studies with children. It recommends and provides examples for developing ethical, safe, and valid testing methods. It focuses specifically on the concerns relevant to testing with children from birth through preadolescence. The guide assumes that minors older than 15 years of age are generally capable of performing sensory tests like adults, and therefore, all standard procedures used with adult subjects apply. The one exception, however, is legal consent where parental/legal guardian permission should be obtained for anyone under 18 years of age.   1.2 This guide will take into account the wide range of children's physical, emotional, and cognitive levels of development. It will prove useful for developing tasks that are understandable to children. It recommends alternative modes for children to communicate their opinions or perceptions back to the researcher, such as appropriate scales and measures.   1.3 The ethical standard presented in this document should be viewed as a minimum requirement for testing with minors. The safety and protection of children as respondents, as well as an attitude of respect for the value of their input should be of primary concern to the researcher.   1.4 The considerations raised in this document may also be useful when testing with the elderly or with adults who have developmental handicaps.   1.5 This document is not intended to be a complete description of reliable sensory testing techniques and methodologies.

,F2714-08(2021),Standard Test Method for Oxygen Headspace Analysis of Packages Using Fluorescent Decay,"Significance and Use  3.1 The oxygen content of a package’s headspace is an important determinant of the packaging protection afforded by barrier materials. The package under test is typically MAP (modified atmosphere packaging) packaged.   3.2 Oxygen content is a key contributor to off-flavors and spoilage of various products, such as chemicals, food and pharmaceuticals.   3.3 The method determines the oxygen in a closed package headspace. This ability has application in:   3.3.1  Package Permeability Studies— The change of headspace composition over a known length of time allows the calculation of permeation. Since the headspace oxygen is measured as a percentage, the volume of the container’s headspace must be known to allow conversion into a quantity such as millilitres (ml) of oxygen. The use of this approach to measure permeation generally applies to empty package systems only as oxygen uptake or outgassing of contained products could affect results.   3.3.2  Leak Detection— If the headspace contains more oxygen than expected or is increasing faster than expected, a leak can be suspected. A wide variety of techniques can be employed to verify that a leak is present and to identify its location. If necessary or of interest, a leak rate may be calculated with known headspace volume and measured oxygen concentration change over time.   3.3.3  Efficacy of the MAP Packaging Process— If the headspace oxygen concentration is found to be higher than expected soon after packaging, the gas flushing process may not be working as well as expected. Various techniques can evaluate whether the MAP system is functioning properly.   3.3.4  Storage Studies— As the method is non-destructive, the headspace can be monitored over time on individual samples to insure that results of storage studies such as shelf life testing are correctly interpreted. Scope  1.1 This test method covers a procedure for determination of the oxygen concentration in the headspace within a sealed package without opening or compromising the integrity of the package.   1.2 This test method requires that chemically coated components be placed on the inside surface of the package before closing.   1.3 The package must be either transparent, translucent, or a transparent window must be affixed to the package surface without affecting the package’s integrity.   1.4 As this test method determines the oxygen headspace over time, the oxygen permeability can easily be calculated as ingress per unit time as long as the volume of the container is known.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F3169-16,Standard Test Method for Leak Detection in Blister Packaging by Vacuum Deflection Method  by Laser Measurement,"Significance and Use   5.1 Leaks in blister packs may affect product quality and such defects can arise from imperfections in the packaging material or bond between the sealed surfaces.   5.2 This method of leak testing is a useful tool as it allows non-destructive and non-subjective leak testing of blister packs. It allows the operator to evaluate how different packaging materials and packaging machine conditions affect the integrity of the packaging. It can also provide indication of unwanted changes in the packaging conditions.   5.3 This type of testing is typically used in pharmaceutical packaging production, during stability trials and for package research and development operations because of its non-destructive nature, cleanliness, and speed. Scope   1.1  Test Packages— This test method can be applied to non-porous blister packs sealed with flexible films such as those used in pharmaceutical packaging. Such blister packs typically consist of thermoformed polymer or cold formed aluminum trays that contain a number of individual blister pockets into which tablets or capsules are placed. The trays are then sealed with a polymer, paper-backed or foil-based flexible laminate lidding material.   1.2  Leaks Detected— This test method detects leaks in blister packs by measuring the deflection of the blister pack surface in response to an applied vacuum. This deflection of the blister pack surface results from the difference in pressure between the gas inside the blister pack and the applied vacuum. Air loss from within a blister pocket as a result of a leak will alter this pressure differential causing a measureable variation in blister pocket deflection. This test method requires that the blister packs are held in appropriate tooling inside a suitable test chamber.   1.3  Test Results— Test results are reported qualitatively (pass/fail). Appropriate acceptance criteria for deflection , height , and collapse values are established by comparing non-leaking packs with those containing defects of a known size. Suitably sized defects in the laminate, tray material, and seal can be detected using this test method. The sensitivity of this test method depends upon a range of factors including blister pocket headspace, blister pocket size, lidding material type, lidding material thickness, lidding material tension, printing, surface texture, test conditions, and the values selected for the pass/fail acceptance criteria. The ability of the test to detect 15 µm, 50 µm, and catastrophic sized holes in four blister pack designs was demonstrated in a study.   1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard and no other units of measurement are included in this test method.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

,E2550-21,Standard Test Method for  Thermal Stability by Thermogravimetry,"Significance and Use  5.1 Thermogravimetry provides a rapid method for determining the thermal decomposition and reaction mass change of a material.   5.2 This test method is useful in detecting potentially hazardous reactions and in estimating the temperatures at which these reactions occur. This test method is recommended as a screening test for detecting the thermal hazards of an uncharacterized material or mixture (see Section 8 ).   5.3 Energetic materials, pharmaceuticals and polymers are examples of materials for which this test might be useful. This test is especially useful for materials having melting points that overlap with the onset of reaction or decomposition.  Note 1:  In differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the melting endotherm may interfere with the determination of the onset temperature for reaction or decomposition.   5.4 This test is not suitable for materials that sublime or vaporize in the temperature range of interest. A sample with volatile impurities needs to be purified prior to testing by thermogravimetric analysis. Alternatively, the sample can be tested as is, however, special caution is required during the data analysis. The mass loss due to the loss of impurity should not interfere with the determination of reaction or decomposition temperature.   5.5 The four significant criteria of this test method are: the detection of a sample mass change; the extent of the mass change; the approximate temperature at which the event occurs; the observance of effects due to the atmosphere. Scope  1.1 This test method describes the assessment of material thermal stability through the determination of the temperature at which the materials start to decompose or react and the extent of the mass change using thermogravimetry. The test method uses minimum quantities of material and is applicable over the temperature range from ambient to 800 °C.   1.2 The absence of reaction or decomposition is used as an indication of thermal stability in this test method under the experimental conditions used.   1.3 This test method may be performed on solids or liquids, which do not sublime or vaporize in the temperature range of interest.   1.4 This test method shall not be used by itself to establish a safe operating or storage temperature. It may be used in conjunction with other test methods (for example, Test Methods E487 and E537 , and Guide E1981 ) as part of a hazard analysis of a material.   1.5 This test method is normally applicable to reaction or decomposition occurring in the range from room temperature to 800 °C. The temperature range may be extended depending on the instrumentation used.   1.6 This test method may be performed in an inert, a reactive or self-generated atmosphere.   1.7 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

The ongoing process of method validation is graphically represented in Fig. 1 , which shows the life cycle of the validation of analytical methods for PAT applications. Prerequisites for validation are the identification of the measurement requirements and development of a method to meet those requirements.  FIG. 1 Life Cycle for the Validation of Analytical Method for PAT Applications   4.2 The method risk assessment also takes into account the stage in the product life cycle at which the measurements are being made and how the resulting data will be used. The integration of these considerations in the risk assessment facilitates the determination of the level of validation necessary to ensure that the method is fit for purpose.   4.3 Changes may occur during the product life cycle necessitating identification of changes to the measurement requirements and method update and revalidation. Procedures should be established to evaluate the continued suitability of the process analytical method and to make appropriate recommendations to update the process analytical method for the intended use during the product life cycle.   4.4 Additional informative examples can be found in Practices D3764 , D6122 , E1655 , E1790 , E2056 , E2617 , and E2656 ; and Guide E2891 that address validation of methods and models. Other useful standards include ASME BPE2019, ISO 14971, ISO 15839, and USP Acoustic Emission <1005>. Scope  1.1 This guide provides an overview to the risk-based validation of process analytical methods under a process analytical technology (PAT) paradigm for pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals and as such includes guidance on assessing risk to product quality from inappropriate method validation.   1.2 This guide builds on existing standards on the topic of validation concentrating on applying such standards to analytical methods for on-line analysis. In particular, it addresses the validation of at-line, on-line, or in-line PAT measurements and covers both drug substance and drug product (DP) measurements.   1.3 The definitions of International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) validation parameters (such as specificity, precision, repeatability, etc.) apply; however, the method of demonstrating the validation parameters may vary from that described in ICH and is discussed.   1.4 As consistent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process validation guidance, this document also briefly covers ongoing assurance that the method remains in a validated state during routine use.   1.5 Equipment and instrument qualification are out of the scope of this guide but will be referenced as inputs to validation of analytical methods for PAT applications.   1.6 The validation of multivariate prediction models is out of scope but will be referenced as inputs to validation of analytical methods for PAT applications.   1.6.1 The validation of any analytical model used in the PAT method is essential to the validation of the PAT method but, the details of the model validation process is out of scope.

,E3230-20,Standard Practice for Extraction of Particulate Matter from the Surfaces of Single-Use  Components and Assemblies Designed for Use in Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing,"Significance and Use  4.1 Conventional stainless-steel process equipment for biopharmaceutical manufacturing require cleaning and sterilization prior to implementation. Single-use systems (SUS), stand-alone equipment typically composed of plastic components and assemblies, are usually assembled in cleanrooms and are usually not cleaned or rinsed prior to implementation (with the exception of filters, which are often rinsed prior to use). SUS cleanliness with respect to particulate matter depends upon the quality of the SUS manufacturing process, and also upon the care and handling of the SUS upon implementation by the end-user.   4.2 In the process of manufacturing single-use components or assemblies, particulate matter may adhere to the interior (fluid contacting) or exterior surfaces of SUS (BPSA). Visual inspection of SUS components and assemblies for particulate matter is often limited by translucent or opaque materials which inhibit visualization, especially of interior fluid-contacting surfaces. Also in some cases, the large size of single-use assemblies significantly reduces the effectiveness of visual inspections. A more complete assessment of particulate matter load requires a method to extract particulate matter from the surfaces of single-use components or assemblies using a test liquid, which makes the particles readily available for analytical characterization using counting, sizing and chemical/physical identification methods.   4.3 Pharmaceutical manufacturers use a wide variety of configurations and sizes of single-use components and assemblies, such as bioreactors, bioprocess containers, tubing, connectors, clamps, valves, sensors and filters. Extraction of particulate matter may be relatively easy from small components with readily accessible surfaces, however, extraction of particulate matter from large and complex assemblies with less readily accessible interior surfaces may require significantly more effort.   4.4 The wide variety of single-use components and assemblies inhibits specification of a narrowly defined extraction procedure with a universally prescribed volume of test liquid and energy input (rinsing/agitation) conditions. The approach described in this practice allows for flexibility and innovative approaches to maximize particle extraction which are specifically tailored to the component or assembly of interest.   4.5 In most cases, relatively small amounts of particulate matter are non-uniformly dispersed over large surface areas, and the particulate matter also is often inhomogeneous in chemical composition and morphology. Standardized single-use components and assemblies with controlled amounts of known standardized particulate matter which simulate real systems are challenging to prepare. Thus in the development of a particle extraction procedure, a practical and expedient methodology is required to assess whether the chosen extraction procedure is effective and extracts as many particles as practically possible   4.6 A well-established standardized methodology for demonstrating effective extraction of particles from the surfaces of automotive components provides guidance (ISO 16232:2018, VDA 19 Part 1). The standard practice described here for the extraction of particulate matter from the surfaces of single-use components and assemblies is closely based upon the principles described in the ISO 16232:2018 standard for automotive components. This “multiple extractions” approach to qualification of an extraction procedure significantly increases the probability that particulate matter adhering to surfaces is removed upon extraction, and that the extraction procedure so qualified is effective. The qualification criterion described in this practice is essentially the same as the “declining criterion” described in ISO 16232:2018. In essence, this criterion requires that during qualification the chosen extraction procedure must achieve an effectiveness of greater than 90% particle removal on a relative basis.   4.7 Note that this practice does not specify the particle measurement method required to count and size the particles. The qualification of the extraction procedure described in this practice will be compatible with particle measurement methods typically used for both so-called “visible” ( ≥ 100 micron) or “sub-visible” (10 to 100 micron) particle size ranges (USP <788>, USP <1788>, USP <790>), which includes methods such as light obscuration, membrane microscopy or dynamic flow imaging (Guide E3060 ). In order for this practice to be effective, the chosen particle measurement method shall have been qualified for reliable determination of the particle count (number of particles in the particle size range of interest).   4.8 The overall goal of a chosen extraction procedure for particulate matter on the surfaces of single-use components and assemblies is to maximize the probability that particles are extracted in an effective, practical, consistent and controlled way. Scope  1.1 This practice describes the requirements for development, qualification, and routine application of a procedure for the effective liquid extraction of particulate matter from the surfaces of single-use components and assemblies designed for use in biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The extraction generates a suspension of particulate matter in liquid which makes the particulate matter readily available for analytical characterization.   1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E2629-20,Standard Guide for  Verification of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Enabled  Control Systems,"Significance and Use  5.1 This guide supports the principles of Guide E2500 and extends these principles to the verification of PAT-enabled control systems.   5.2 This guide clarifies what is important for verification of PAT-enabled control systems. Such systems are often complex and require multidisciplinary and cross-functional teams to achieve optimum results. This guide provides a common basis for understanding requirements for all involved disciplines such as control engineering, development, manufacturing, and process validation. Scope  1.1 This guide describes the verification of process analytical technology (PAT) enabled control systems using a science- and risk-based approach. It establishes principles for determining the scope and extent of verification activities necessary to ensure that the PAT-enabled control system is fit for purpose, properly implemented, and functions as expected.   1.2 In this guide, a PAT-enabled control system is considered to be the system that adjusts the manufacturing process using timely measurements (that is, during processing) of attributes of raw and in-process materials to determine responses that assure the process remains within specified boundaries and minimizes variability in the output material. The overall aim of the PAT-enabled control system is to ensure product quality. The PAT-enabled control system of a manufacturing process provides the capability to determine the current status of the process and drive the process to ensure the output material has the desired quality characteristics. The control system should be able to respond to process variations in a timely manner, providing corrections that ensure that the process follows the desired process trajectory to reach the desired outcome. PAT-enabled control systems may use process models based on first principles understanding or empirical models derived from experimental investigations or both. In addition to automated controls, a PAT-enabled control system may include components where there is manual intervention.   1.3 Principles described in this guide may be applied regardless of the complexity or scale of the PAT-enabled control system or whether applied to batch or continuous processing, or both. The intention of this standard is to describe and support the implementation of a PAT enabled Control Strategy, as described in ICH Q8(R2).   1.4 The principles described in this guide are applicable to a PAT-enabled control system and also to its component subsystems. This guide does not cover the requirements for continuous quality verification of the overall process, which are covered in Guide E2537 , or for validation of PAT methods, which is covered in Guide E2898 .   1.5 For information on science- and risk-based approaches in the pharmaceutical industry, reference should be made to ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, and ICH Q10. For guidance on PAT systems in the pharmaceutical industry, reference should be made to FDA Guidance for Industry—PAT and FDA Guidance for Industry—Process Validation, as well as EU Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use and EU Guideline on Process Validation for Finished Products.   1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F1416-96(2019),Standard Guide for  Selection of Time-Temperature Indicators,"Significance and Use  3.1 Expiration dates are often marked on the packages of perishable products to indicate the presumed end of their shelf lives. Since the shelf lives of most perishable products are temperature dependent, the expiration date is determined by assuming the product will be kept within a prescribed temperature range for its entire life. A problem with this method is that there is no way to determine if the shelf life of a product has been shortened by exposure to a higher temperature. A time-temperature indicator solves this problem when attached to the package because it reaches its end point sooner when exposed to a higher temperature.   3.2 In order to directly indicate the end of the shelf life, the time-temperature indicator characteristics should be matched as closely as possible to the quality characteristics of the product. When kept at the standard storage temperature for the product, the indicator should reach its end point at the same time as the product's shelf life. In addition, to determine the accuracy of the match at other temperatures, the change of shelf life with temperature should be known for both the product and the indicator. The Arrhenius relationship is a common and convenient method of describing the change of shelf life with temperature. In cases where it is not applicable, individual time-temperature points for the product may be established and an approximate correlation with the TTI obtained.   3.3 When attached to the package of a perishable product, a time-temperature indicator may supplement, or in some cases replace, the expiration date code. The addition of a TTI provides a greater level of confidence that the perishable product is within its shelf life because it responds to the actual temperature conditions to which the product has been exposed.   3.4 In the case of minimally processed refrigerated foods, the rapid growth of pathogenic bacteria at elevated temperatures may pose a serious health hazard even before the deterioration of the quality of the product becomes apparent to the consumer. In this case, an expiration date may be used for storage at the standard temperature, while a threshold-temperature TTI is used to indicate the exposure to temperatures at which growth becomes measurable. It is also possible to use a dual-function TTI, in which case the standard TTI would indicate the shelf life at the correct storage temperature while the threshold-temperature part would indicate the exposure to higher temperatures. Scope  1.1 This guide covers information on the selection of commercially available time-temperature indicators (TTIs) for noninvasive external package use on perishable products, such as food and pharmaceuticals. When attached to the package of a perishable product, TTIs are used to measure the combined time and temperature history of the product in order to predict the remaining shelf life of the product or to signal the end of its usable shelf life. It is the responsibility of the processor of the perishable product to determine the shelf life of a product at the appropriate temperatures and to consult with the indicator manufacturer to select the available indicator which most closely matches the quality of the product as a function of time and temperature.  Note 1:  Besides time-temperature indicator, TTI is also an abbreviation for time-temperature monitor and time-temperature integrator.   1.2 Time-temperature indicators may be integrated into a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. Appropriate instructions should be established for handling products for which either the indicator has signaled the end of usable shelf life or the shelf life of the product at its normal storage temperature has been reached.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.4  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E3177-24,Standard Guide on Sampling for Process Analytical Technology,"Significance and Use  4.1 Application of this guidance should enable PAT method developers to design and implement reliable PAT applications that avoid many common sources of error around sampling. Sampling is a key element of method and process validation plans. Scientific and statistical principles should be used in combination with appropriate risk assessment tools to ensure that the sampling approach is suitable for the application.   4.1.1 Many ASTM standards discuss sampling; however, almost all are very specific to a certain field or application. For example, the “Practice for Automatic Sampling of Petroleum and Petroleum Products” ( D4177 ) specifically covers information for the design, installation, testing, and operation of automated equipment for the extraction of representative samples of petroleum and petroleum products from a flowing stream and storing them in a sample receiver.   4.1.2 Other useful ASTM standards include: E105 (Practice for Probability Sampling of Materials), E122 (Practice for Calculating Sample Size to Estimate, With a Specified Precision, the Average for a Characteristic of a Lot or Process), E1402 (Guide for Sampling Design), and E456 (Terminology Relating to Quality and Statistics). These standards review similar considerations as those addressed in this guidance and can be consulted for additional insight on how to deal with specific sample types or situations. However, such standards should be carefully reviewed for relevance to pharmaceutical applications. Scope  1.1 This document is to be used as a guide to Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instrument sampling and covers both the sample from which PAT data is collected and the sample that is taken for reference analysis. The ASTM definition of a guide is a compendium of information or series of options that does not recommend a specific course of action. The intention of a guide is to increases the awareness of information and approaches in a given subject area. As such, this guide should serve as a collection of points to consider when determining a sample practice for PAT instruments. It is not intended to serve as a practice to be followed. As a first step, one should define the overall goal of the PAT measurement. Once defined, this guide describes various considerations as they relate to the specific requirements that must be met to achieve the overall PAT goal, including the attributes to be measured, impact of the scale of the process, and interfacing of the measurement system to manufacturing equipment (including sampling system reliability). Additionally, it discusses the estimation and validation of the effective sample size and the overall contribution to the measurement. Related aspects of data collection and data processing as well as the use of risk assessments to optimize sampling and to understand the impact of potential sampling errors are also covered. Furthermore, considerations for process control and aspects pertaining to sample withdrawal and retention are included. Lastly, continuous manufacturing processes differ from batch manufacturing due to the time dependency associated with continuous operations and special considerations are needed for sampling of such processes.   1.2 This guide is limited to a high-level overview of sampling considerations for PAT applied to any type of pharmaceutical manufacturing. It is not intended to provide technology- or application-specific sampling guidance. Instead, the intent is to evoke a thought process around sampling when developing a PAT application. While the focus is mainly on sampling considerations for on/in-line applications in solids, liquids, and gases (that is, in situ PAT measurements), many of the considerations also apply to at-line and off-line applications in which a sample is withdrawn from the process and subsequently presented for analysis.   1.3  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E3409-24,Standard Test Method for Analysis of Liposomal Drug Formulations Using Multidetector  Asymmetrical-Flow Field-Flow Fractionation,"Significance and Use  5.1 Liposomal formulations for the treatment of cancer and other diseases are the most common form of nanotechnology-enabled drug products submitted for market approval and in clinical application at the present time. The accurate characterization of their physical-chemical properties is critical to support the development and assessment of such products ( 2 ) . In particular, size, size distribution, shape, and physical stability are key properties (among others) that have been widely identified as critical quality attributes (CQAs) for liposomal drug products.   5.1.1 Asymmetrical-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) is a chromatographic-like technique that uses hydrodynamic forces to gently separate analytes into their component populations according to size and diffusivity ( 3 and 4 ) . The fractionated sample then passes through one or more online detectors chosen specifically for the application requirements. The combination of low-shear separation, tolerance for complex matrices, and exceptionally broad size range make AF4 a technique of choice for application to nanotechnology-enabled drug products such as liposomes ( 1 3 , 5- 9 ) .   5.1.2 Multi-detector AF4 is suitable for research and development, manufacturing quality control, product stability/shelf-life testing and regulatory assessments.   5.1.3 There are multiple assumptions inherent in the application of MD-AF4, including the appropriateness of models used to interpret online light scattering data and the compatibility of the analyte and matrix with the membrane that forms the surface of the accumulation wall in the fractionation channel. Other assumptions are detector or analyte specific.   5.2 Chemical components of the mobile phase must not induce agglomeration of liposomes or otherwise significantly alter their physical properties.   5.3 Discretion should be used in the interpretation of size data obtained by different scattering detectors using different scattering models and modes of analysis.   5.4 The Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals (see 21 CFR 211.194(a)(2)) and the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline on Validation of Analytical Procedures Q2(R1) ( 10 ) , state that the suitability of all test methods shall be verified under actual conditions of use.   5.5 MD-AF4 can be compared with batch mode dynamic light scattering (DLS) for the determination of liposome mean size and size distribution, where MD-AF4 provides deconvolution of complex mixtures yielding a more accurate assessment of the populations present. Batch mode DLS (see, for instance, Test Method E3247 ) provides a rapid, low-cost approach that can be used to screen materials prior to analysis by MD-AF4. The latter requires substantially more analyst time and effort along with appropriate training and expertise. Qualitatively, MD-AF4 offers greater insight into the physical complexity of a sample via the fractionation process in combination with multiple detectors. Scope  1.1 This test method describes a measurement procedure to reproducibly separate component size populations present within liposomal drug formulations and to characterize their associated size and size distribution. The method can also yield information on the shape and physical stability of the liposomes and is applicable to measurements in the presence of serum proteins. Fractions can be collected for off-line analysis using various techniques not specified in this test method.   1.2 This test method applies to uni-lamellar and multi-lamellar liposomes that are designed for drug delivery and which are dispersed in a native solution that is aqueous in nature. The method is generally applicable over a particle size range (radius) of approximately 10 nm to 250 nm, and for injected lipid mass from 20 µg to 200 µg.   1.3 This test method is based on the multi-detector asymmetrical-flow field-flow fractionation (MD-AF4) technique as configured on a typical commercial instrument platform with online detectors such as multi-angle (static) light scattering (MALS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance, and differential refractive index (dRI) ( 1 ) . 2    1.4 This method does not address liposome composition.

A plateau occurs with specimens containing appreciable amounts of hydrocarbons that crystallize at the same temperature, giving up heat of fusion, thus temporarily retarding the cooling rate. In general, petroleum waxes with large amounts of non-normal hydrocarbons or with amorphous solid forms will not exhibit a plateau. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of the melting point (cooling curve) of petroleum wax. It is unsuitable for waxes of the petrolatum group, microcrystalline waxes, or blends of such waxes with paraffin wax or scale wax.  Note 1:  For additional methods used for testing petroleum waxes, see Test Method D127 and Test Method D938 . Results may differ, depending on the method used. For pharmaceutical petrolatum, Test Method D127 usually is used.   1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E2717-18,Standard Practice for Estimating the Environmental Load of Residential Wastewater,"Significance and Use  5.1 There is increasing concern regarding water quality. The first national-scale U.S. examination of these organic wastewater contaminants in streams, conducted by the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), indicated that a broad range of chemicals found in residential, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters commonly occurs in mixtures at low concentrations downstream from areas of intense urbanization and animal production. The chemicals include pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic hormones, detergent metabolites, plasticizers, insecticides, and fire retardants. One or more of these chemicals were found in 80 % of the streams sampled. 6   5.2 This practice may be used by building owners and design professionals to assess water stewardship impacts of a residence. In particular, it is intended to inform design decisions and operation decisions regarding estimated wastewater quality impacts of a building.   5.3 This practice may be used by planners and water treatment professionals to assess water stewardship impacts of a residential area. In particular, it is intended to inform infrastructure decisions regarding estimated wastewater quality impacts of a residential service area.   5.3.1 This practice may be used to estimate the types and amounts of non-biological wastes entering a wastewater system. Such knowledge is becoming increasingly important in developing sustainable approaches to water stewardship.   5.4  Table 2 , Environmental Load for Average U.S. Single-Family Home, does not list all chemicals used in homes; in order to obtain a more accurate estimation, the chemicals used in specific homes should be listed. In addition, it may be helpful to monitor wastewater to determine variances, if any, from the estimated environmental load.  Scope  1.1 This practice provides a set of instructions for estimating the environmental load of residential water, as it is discharged from a residence. The environmental load is calculated based on the number and type of fixtures in the home, the common household chemicals used, and the number of people in the home. While the format is broadly applied internationally, the parameters stated herein reflect North American averages and would need to be modified if used elsewhere.   1.1.1  Averages Method— The Averages Method provides an estimate of the annual environmental load for the average U.S. single-family home based on 2000 U.S. Census 2 and 2007 U.S. Census Data 3 and U.S. EPA/625/R-00/008 characterization of residential wastewater flows. 4  Note 1:  Census 2000, taken April 1, 2000, counted 281 421 906 people in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The questionnaire included seven questions for each household: name, sex, age, relationship, Hispanic origin, race, and whether the housing unit was owned or rented. In addition to these seven questions, about 17 percent of the households got a much longer questionnaire including questions about ancestry, income, mortgage, and size of the housing unit.   1.1.2  Unique Product Parameters Method— The Unique Product Parameters Method provides an estimate of the annual environmental load, where the home/product parameter values are the same as those used for the Averages Method except for estimated amounts of chemical contaminants listed in Table 1 or average total annual use of products as listed in Table 1 , or both.    1.1.3  Adjusted Averages Method— The Adjusted Averages Method provides an estimate of the annual environmental load, where home/product parameter values differ from those used for the Averages Method, except that chemical contaminants associated with products do not vary. ( Table 1 remains the same for: Typical Water Contaminants, Estimated Amount of Contaminant in Product (%), and the Percent Waste.)   1.1.4  Additional/Alternative Chemicals Method— The Additional/Alternative Chemicals Method provides an estimate of the annual environmental load, of chemicals used that are not listed in Table 1 .   1.1.5 The Unique Product Parameters Method, Adjusted Averages Method, and Additional Chemicals Method may be used in combination with each other.   1.2 Instructions are provided for a single-family home. Estimates may be expanded to an aggregate number of single-family homes by assuming an average home size and multiplying by the number of homes. Estimates may be adapted to multi-unit residential buildings by factoring the home parameters for size, occupancy, and fixtures as necessary.   1.3 For the purpose of this practice, environmental load refers to chemical contaminants that may be dissolved or suspended in water.   1.3.1 Estimates of environmental load do not include organic matter common for urine, feces, and vomit.   1.3.2 Estimates of environmental load do not include bulk food waste such as kitchen scraps.   1.3.3 Estimates of environmental load do not include bulk cellulose waste such as toilet paper.   1.3.4 Estimates of environmental load do not include other solid wastes, such as wrappers, not covered by the waste groups covered in 1.3.1 through 1.3.3 .   1.3.5 Actual environmental load may vary depending on types and amounts of chemicals used in a specific home and the number of people in the home.   1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

Normally the testing is run on a portion of the seal. The result is an actual seal strength picture of that portion of the seal. This test method is different in that the entire package seal is peeled open and data collected for the entire sealed area.   5.2 This test method is a tool for quality assurance use as well as performance evaluation of a seal during separation.   5.3 With appropriate software, data is collected depicting the seal strength of the entire length of the seal. As a result, it is possible to see seal strength variations, as the seal is peeled apart, thereby evaluating the consistency and uniformity of the seal (see Fig. 1 ). Scope  1.1 This test method describes a method for the measurement of mechanical seal strength while separating the entire lid (cover/membrane) from a rigid or semi-rigid round container.   1.2 This test method differs from Test Method F88 . Test Method F88 tests a portion of the seal where as this test method tests the force required to separate the entire lid (cover/membrane) from the container.   1.3 This test method is used to determine the continuous and maximum forces required to separate the lid (cover/membrane) from the container.   1.4 This test method uses an angle of pull of 45°, however other angles of pull may be used provided results are documented noting the used angle of pull and said procedure is validated.   1.5 Typical examples of container shapes that could be tested using this or a similar method include oval, rectangular, and circular with single or multiple cavities having a sealed lid (cover/membrane).

Process materials leach low level of residues into water, cell culture media, buffers, and other product containing solutions. This document offers guidance on determining the safety of these materials (process materials) for use. The goal is to prevent toxic extractables from entering process streams and ultimately contaminating the final product in unacceptable levels.   4.2 The purpose of this guide is to describe tests to qualify materials with respect to any extractable substances so as to prevent unintentional introduction of a potential source of objectionable substances. An extractable material is objectionable if it is toxic, interacts with product constituents, interferes with required assays, or otherwise affects the process stream so as to adversely affect critical quality parameters, for example, purity, safety, efficacy, identity, strength of the final product or its successful production. All organizations producing pharmaceutical products should consider the points in this guide when qualifying process materials for use in their production processes.   4.3 This guide outlines the application of the process material tests primarily in ASTM or USP. Typical process materials include high molecular weight polymers and solids such as hoses, filters, filter housings, containers, valve diaphragms, gaskets, o-rings, chromatography resins, and chromatographic columns.   4.4 The battery of tests described in this guide is intended to cover a wide variety of potential attributes of materials and to characterize possible extractables.   4.5 The material specification will vary depending on the impact on the final product and the point in the process that the product solution contacts the material. Tighter specifications should be considered for extractables for final product purification process materials than for fermentation media process materials. Scope  1.1 This guide covers procedures and test methods for process component qualification by the end user. The goal is to assess the safety impact of extractables from non-metallic process components used in contact with bioprocessing solutions. This encompasses the impact of extractables on the safety of the final product as it passes through the various stages of the manufacturing process.

The cholesterol component plays a key role in controlled drug release by adding stability to the liposome. A small variation in the lipid composition can significantly alter the parameters mentioned above ( 15 ) .   5.2 Variation in the lipid composition in the liposomal formulation may influence the safety and efficacy of the product. Therefore, chemical composition of the liposomes shall be determined.   5.3 The pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies require QC, QA, specifications, thorough characterization, and quantification of lipid components ( 16 , 17 ) .   5.4 This test method can be used to ascertain variations in the lipid component profiling of various liposomal formulations. However, this test method does not intend to identify chemical degradation products ( 18 ) .   5.5 Analyzing the stability of analytes and their chemical degradation profiles as a result of oxidation or hydrolysis is beyond the scope of this test method ( 18 , 19 ) . Scope  1.1 This test method describes an analytical technique to quantify lipid components that are often present in liposomal formulations as major components.   1.2 This test method uses high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate lipids in liposomal formulations and evaporative light-scattering detection (ELSD) to quantify the individual components.   1.3 This test method quantifies three major organic components in liposomal formulations: cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG 2000), and hydrogenated soy L-α-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC).   1.4 This test method can estimate the absolute concentration of cholesterol, DSPE-PEG 2000, and HSPC and their ratio (DSPE-PEG 2000: HSPC: cholesterol) in liposomal formulations.   1.5 This test method describes preparation of calibration standards and samples, HPLC and ELSD instrumentation, method development and method validation, sample analysis, and data reporting.   1.6 The detection limits and quantitation limits for the analytes (lipid components) in this test method are in the range of 2 µg/g to 4 µg/g and 7 µg/g to 10 μg/g, respectively.

,D6317-15(2024),"Standard Test Method for  Low Level Determination of Total Carbon, Inorganic Carbon and   Organic Carbon in Water by Ultraviolet, Persulfate Oxidation, and   Membrane Conductivity  Detection","Significance and Use  5.1 This test method is used for determination of the carbon content of water from a variety of natural, domestic, and industrial sources. In its most common form, this test method is used to measure organic carbon as a means of monitoring organic impurities in high purity process water used in industries such as nuclear power, pharmaceutical, and electronics. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC), and total organic carbon (TOC) in water in the range from 10 μg/L to 1000 μg/L of carbon. This method is for laboratory or grab sample applications and has been subjected to an interlaboratory study under the guidelines of Practice D2777 . Test Method D5997 can be used for on-line determinations. The test method utilizes persulfate or ultraviolet oxidation of organic carbon, or both coupled with a CO 2 selective membrane to recover the CO 2 into deionized water. The change in conductivity of the deionized water is measured and related to carbon concentration in the oxidized sample. Inorganic carbon is determined in a similar manner without the oxidation step. In both cases, the sample is acidified to facilitate CO 2 recovery through the membrane. The relationship between the conductivity measurement and carbon concentration is described by a set of chemometric equations for the chemical equilibrium of CO 2 , HCO 3 – , and H + , and the relationship between the ionic concentrations and the conductivity. The chemometric model includes the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants and the specific conductances resulting in linear response of the method over the stated range of TOC. See Test Method D4519 for a discussion of the measurement of CO 2 by conductivity.   1.2 This test method has the advantage of a very high sensitivity detector that allows very low detection levels on relatively small volumes of sample. Also, use of two measurement channels allows determination of CO 2 in the sample independently of organic carbon. Isolation of the conductivity detector from the sample by the CO 2 selective membrane results in a very stable calibration, with minimal interferences.   1.3 This test method was used successfully with reagent water spiked with various organic materials. It is the user's responsibility to ensure the validity of this test method for waters of untested matrices.   1.4 In addition to laboratory analyses, this test method may be adapted to on line monitoring.

,F3320-18(2024),Standard Guide for Coating Characterization of Drug-Coated Balloons,"Significance and Use  5.1 The methods described herein allow for in vitro characterization of DCB drug coating attributes that, along with pre-clinical and clinical safety and effectiveness data, establish that the DCBs, with the characterized coating attributes, are safe and effective. Clinical safety and therapeutic benefit may be affected by nonuniform distribution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, coating anomalies on the device, and particulate release. Variability in drug coating may result in insufficient or excessive drug availability and inconsistent device performance.   5.2 Individual characterization tests may not have direct clinical relevance, although bench-based characterization results can be combined with other data to provide insight to characteristics that influence clinical safety and effectiveness. Bench testing is performed under repeatable and controlled conditions, providing information about drug coating integrity, thickness, uniformity, particulate shedding, particulate identity, and particulate crystallinity.   5.3 Distribution of the drug coating is characterized by coating integrity, thickness, and uniformity. Particulate counts can provide a measure of manufacturing repeatability, and may provide an indication of in vivo safety if simulated use particulates and in vivo particulates are shown to be similar, or if particulate testing results are correlated to in vivo safety. Chemical identity of particulates and crystallinity may further advise the kinetics related to the potential for particulate persistence, dissolution, or other characteristics which may relate to in vivo safety. Conducting this testing and gathering the data further allows for the potential comparison of devices (e.g., demonstrating equivalence between pre-clinical and clinical devices for these coating attributes).   5.4 The methods described in this guide are for characterization purposes and are not intended for production release testing of drug-coated balloon catheters. However, some content may be applicable to generating release data. The general guidelines presented here may be used for product control at various stages of the product development process. Scope  1.1 This guide describes recommended acute in vitro characterization methods for drug-coated balloon (DCB) coatings. These methods include: coating integrity, coating thickness, drug coating uniformity, and released particulates. Specifically, this guide details:   1.1.1 Characterization of integrity by inspection of the coated balloon surface.   1.1.2 Measurement of coating thickness.   1.1.3 Quantitation of drug coating uniformity (uniformity of drug distribution over the balloon surface) longitudinally and circumferentially.   1.1.4 Quantitation of the number of particulates released, in various size ranges, during simulated use testing (insertion, tracking, deployment, retraction, and withdrawal) along with chemical and crystallinity characterization of particulates.   1.2 This document does not address:   1.2.1 Mechanical testing of drug-coated balloons (DCBs).   1.2.2 Drug substance evaluation (e.g., assay, related substances, uniformity of dosage units) of DCBs.   1.2.3 Production release and stability testing, although some sections may be applicable in whole or in part.   1.2.4 Standard analytical testing (e.g., drug content, drug related substances, drug uniformity of dosage).   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,F2605-16,Standard Test Method for  Determining the Molar Mass of Sodium Alginate by Size Exclusion  Chromatography with Multi-angle Light Scattering Detection (SEC-MALS),"Significance and Use   4.1 The composition and sequential structure of alginate, as well as the molar mass and molar mass distribution, determines the functionality of alginate in an application. For instance, the gelling properties of an alginate are highly dependent upon the composition and molar mass of the polymer.   4.2 Light scattering is one of very few methods available for the determination of absolute molar mass and structure, and it is applicable over the broadest range of molar masses of any method. Combining light scattering detection with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), which sorts molecules according to size, gives the ability to analyze polydisperse samples, as well as to obtain information on branching and molecular conformation. This means that both the number-average and mass-average values for molar mass and size may be obtained for most samples. Furthermore, one has the ability to calculate the distributions of the molar masses and sizes.   4.3 Multi-angle laser light scattering (MALS) is a technique where measurements are made simultaneously over a range of different angles and used to determine the scattering at 0°, which directly relates to molecular weight. MALS detection can be used to obtain information on molecular size, since this parameter is determined by the angular variation of the scattered light. This can be related to branching, aggregation, and molecular conformation. Molar mass can also be determined by detecting scattered light at a single low angle (LALS) and assuming that this is not significantly different from the scattering at 0°.   4.4 Size exclusion chromatography uses columns, which are typically packed with polymer particles containing a network of uniform pores into which solute and solvent molecules can diffuse. While in the pores, molecules are effectively trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the size of the solute molecules. Molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and experience virtually no retention; these are eluted first, in the void volume of the column. Molecules which penetrate the pores will have a larger volume available for diffusion; their retention will depend on their molecular size, with the smaller molecules eluting last.   4.5 For polyelectrolytes, dialysis against the elution buffer has been suggested, in order to eliminate Donnan-type artifacts in the molar mass determination by light scattering ( 1 , 2 ) . 6 However, in the present method, the size exclusion chromatography step preceding the light scatter detection is an efficient substitute for a dialysis step. The sample is separated on SEC columns with large excess of elution buffer for 30 to 40 min, and it is therefore in full equilibrium with the elution buffer when it reaches the MALS detector. Scope   1.1 This test method covers the determination of the molar mass (typically expressed as grams/mole) of sodium alginate intended for use in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications as well as in tissue-engineered medical products (TEMPs) by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering detection (SEC-MALS). A guide for the characterization of alginate has been published as Guide F2064 .   1.2 Alginate used in TEMPs should be well characterized, including the molar mass and polydispersity (molar mass distribution) in order to ensure uniformity and correct functionality in the final product. This test method will assist end users in choosing the correct alginate for their particular application. Alginate may have utility as a scaffold or matrix material for TEMPs, in cell and tissue encapsulation applications, and in drug delivery formulations.   1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E2538-06(2011),Standard Practice for Defining and Implementing Pharmacotherapy Information Services within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Environment and Networked Architectures (Withdrawn 2020),"Significance and Use Health information networks (HINs) have arisen in recent years as a way to share common information within organizational arrangements among those healthcare facilities that have been formed into large, more comprehensive integrated delivery systems (IDS) and managed care organizations (MCO) offering a full range of healthcare services, both inpatient and ambulatory.  The specific organizational structures to which the MCO term was originally applied most probably have evolved into something quite different. Furthermore, IDS organizations are contracting with other organizations that have a market larger than a single IDS itself and are buying such services for themselves rather than offering them internally.  These organizations will need a frame of reference for the global information needed to provide all of the services required during patient care. For a global Concept Model consult ADA Specification 1000.0 – 1000.18 and TR 1039.  Pharmacotherapy will require a number of these services, including those of the clinical laboratory for therapeutic drug monitoring as well as pharmacy services of both resident and nonresident care organizations and stand-alone pharmacies to ensure freedom from medication errors and conduct ongoing investigations of both the outcomes of care and the management of resources related to pharmacotherapy.  Pharmacotherapy functions include prescribing (clinical orders), dispensing, administering, and monitoring, which support “ pharmaceutical care ” defined as “ provision of drug therapy to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes that improve a patient ’ s quality of life. ” These functions address patients ’ needs that require information support as noted in Table 1.  Another aspect of the monitoring function is the development of instrumentation for testing at point of care (POCT) for high-value immediate-benefit services that support pharmacotherapy. POCT, however, needs supervision and training from skilled laboratorians for the actual performers, whether that supervision comes from within the IDS or outside of it. This range of operation is only achievable by distributed HIN structures that shall have the same quality of clinical and data services as offered by laboratories close at hand. Data management of POCT is documented separately (see CLSI POCT1, ASTP2), but such data management for support of pharmacotherapy shall be placed into the broader context of this practice and linked to CLSI LIS-9A. Thus, this practice should be used to first organize the global domain and then the interconnected subdomains. Scope 1.1 This practice applies to the process of defining and documenting the capabilities, logical data sources, and pathways of data exchange regarding pharmacotherapy information services within a given network architecture serving a set of healthcare constituents.  1.2 This practice is not a technical implementation standard but, rather, describes how the implementation methods and techniques can be used to coordinate pharmacotherapy services logically within an electronic health record (EHR) systems environment involving participating organizations and sites connected by a networked communication system.  1.3 This practice covers the content of the nodes and arcs of the resulting logical network involving EHR, pharmacy, and clinical laboratory-capable sites. This practice also considers the various purposes and organizational arrangements for coordinating pharmacotherapy services within the network boundaries and the considerations for connections among external networks.  1.4 This practice refers to other standards for conventions within various data domains, such as pharmacy systems, clinical laboratory information management systems (CLIMS), and EHR systems, and for messaging conventions.  1.5 This practice is intended to outline how integration of pharmacy, CLIMS, and EHR information systems can be undertaken to result in a transparent pharmacotherapy clinical decision support environment, regardless of the underlying implementation architecture, by describing the logical interoperability of information domains as facilitated by information and communications technology (ICT).  1.6 This practice is directed at pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists, clinical laboratorians, information system managers, and information systems vendors for use in planning and implementing coordinated pharmacotherapy services through effective dialog.  1.7 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,F2260-18,Standard Test Method for Determining Degree of Deacetylation in Chitosan Salts by Proton  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) Spectroscopy,"Significance and Use   4.1 The degree of deacetylation of chitosan salts is an important characterization parameter since the charge density of the chitosan molecule is responsible for potential biological and functional effects.   4.2 The degree of deacetylation (% DDA) of water-soluble chitosan salts can be determined by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H NMR). Several workers have reported on the NMR determination of chemical composition and sequential arrangement of monomer units in chitin and chitosan. The test method described is primarily based on the work of Vårum et al. (1991), 5 which represents the first publication on routine determination of chemical composition in chitosans by solution state 1 H NMR spectroscopy. This test method is applicable for determining the % DDA of chitosan chloride and chitosan glutamate salts. It is a simple, rapid, and suitable method for routine use. Quantitative 1 H NMR spectroscopy reports directly on the relative concentration of chemically distinct protons in the sample, consequently, no assumptions, calibration curves or calculations other than determination of relative signal intensity ratios are necessary.   4.3 In order to obtain well-resolved NMR spectra, depolymerization of chitosans to a number average degree of polymerization (DP n ) of ~15 to 30 is required. This reduces the viscosity and increases the mobility of the molecules. Although there are several options for depolymerization of chitosans, the most convenient procedure is that of nitrous acid degradation in deuterated water. The reaction is selective, stoichiometric with respect to GlcN, rapid, and easily controlled (Allan & Peyron, 1995). 6 The reaction selectively cleaves after a GlcN-residue, transforming it into 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose (chitose), consequently, depletion of GlcN after depolymerization is expected. On the other hand, the chitose unit displays characteristic 1 H NMR signals the intensity of which may be estimated and utilized in the calculation of % DDA, eliminating the need for correction factors. Using the intensity of the chitose signals, the number average degree of polymerization can easily be calculated as a control of the depolymerization.   4.4 Samples are equilibrated and analyzed at a temperature of 90 ± 1°C. Elevated sample temperature contributes to reducing sample viscosity and repositions the proton signal of residual water to an area outside that of interest. While samples are not stored at 90°C but only analyzed at this elevated temperature, the NMR tubes should be sealed with a stopper to avoid any evaporation. At a sample pH* of 3.8-4.3 (see 6.1.5 below), artifactual deacetylation of the sample does not occur during the short equilibration and analysis time.   4.5 A general description of NMR can be found in <761> of the USP 35-NF30. Scope   1.1 This test method covers the determination of the degree of deacetylation in chitosan and chitosan salts intended for use in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications as well as in Tissue Engineered Medical Products (TEMPs) by high-resolution proton NMR ( 1 H NMR). A guide for the characterization of chitosan salts has been published as Guide F2103 .   1.2 The test method is applicable for determining the degree of deacetylation (% DDA) of chitosan chloride and chitosan glutamate salts and is valid for % DDA values from 50 up to and including 99. It is simple, rapid, and suitable for routine use. Knowledge of the degree of deacetylation is important for an understanding of the functionality of chitosan salts in TEMP formulations and applications.

For instance, functional and biological effects are highly dependent upon the composition and molar mass of the polymer.   4.2 This test method describes procedures for measurement of molar mass of chitosan chlorides and glutamates, and chitosan base, although it in principle applies to any chitosan salt. The measured molar mass is that for chitosan acetate, since the mobile phase contains acetate as counter ion. This value can further be converted into the corresponding molar mass for the chitosan as a base, or the parent salt form (chloride or glutamate).   4.3 Light scattering is one of very few methods available for the determination of absolute molar mass and structure, and it is applicable over the broadest range of molar masses of any method.

,C1926-23,Standard Test Method for Measurement of Glass Dissolution Rate Using Stirred Dilute  Reactor Conditions on Monolithic Samples,"Significance and Use  5.1 This test method provides a description of the design of the Stirred Reactor Coupon Analysis (SRCA) apparatus and identifies aspects of the performance of the SRCA tests and interpretation of the test results that must be addressed by the experimenter to provide confidence in the measured dissolution rate.   5.2 The SRCA methods described in this test method can be used to characterize several aspects of glass corrosion that can be included in mechanistic models of long-term durability of glasses, including nuclear waste glasses.   5.3 Depending on the test parameters investigated, the SRCA results can be used to measure the intrinsic dilute glass dissolution rate, as well as the effects of conditions such as temperature, pH, and solution chemistry on the dissolution rate.   5.4 Due to the scalable nature of the method, it is particularly applicable to studies of the impact of glass composition on dilute-condition corrosion. Models of glass behavior can be parameterized by testing glass composition matrices and establishing quantitative structure-property relationships.   5.5 The step heights present on the corroded sample can be measured by a variety of techniques including profilometry (optical or stylus), atomic force microscopy, interferometry or other techniques capable of determining relative depths on a sample surface. The sample can also be interrogated with other techniques such as scanning electron microscopy to characterize the corrosion behavior. These further analyses can determine if the sample corroded homogenously and possible formation of secondary phases or leached layers. Occurrence of these features may impact the accuracy of glass dissolution. This test method does not address these solid-state characterizations. Scope  1.1 This test method describes a test method in which the dissolution rate of a homogenous silicate glass is measured through corrosion of monolithic samples in stirred dilute conditions.   1.2 Although the test method was designed for simulated nuclear waste glass compositions per Guide C1174 , the method is applicable to glass compositions for other applications including, but not limited to, display glass, pharmaceutical glass, bioglass, and container glass compositions.   1.3 Various test solutions can be used at temperatures less than 100 °C. While the durability of the glass can be impacted by dissolving species from the glass, and thus the test can be conducted in dilute conditions or concentrated condition to determine the impact of such species, care must be taken to avoid, acknowledge, or account for the production of alteration layers which may confound the step height measurements.   1.4 The dissolution rate measured by this test is, by design, an average of all corrosion that occurs during the test. In dilute conditions, glass is assumed to dissolve congruently and the dissolution rate is assumed to be constant.   1.5 Tests are carried out via the placement of the monolithic samples in a large well-mixed volume of solution, achieving a high volume to surface area ratio resulting in dilute conditions with agitation of the solution.   1.6 This test method excludes test methods using powdered glass samples, or in which the reactor solution saturates with time. Glass fibers may be used without a mask if the diameter is known to high accuracy before the test.   1.7 Tests may be conducted with ASTM Type I water (see Specification D1193 and Terminology D1129 ), buffered water or other chemical solutions, simulated or actual groundwaters, biofluids, or other dissolving solutions.   1.8 Tests are conducted with monolithic glass samples with at least a single flat face. Although having two plane-parallel faces is helpful for certain step height measurements, it is not required. The geometric dimensions of the monolith are not required to be known. The reacted monolithic sample is to be analyzed following the reaction to measure a corroded depth to determine dissolution rate.   1.9 Tests may be performed with radioactive samples. However, safety concerns working with radionuclides are not addressed in this test method.   1.10 Data from these tests can be used to determine the value of kinetic rate model parameters needed to predict glass corrosion behavior over long periods of time. For an example, see Practice C1662 , section 9.5.   1.11 This test method must be performed in accordance with all quality assurance requirements for acceptance of the data.   1.12  Units— The values stated in SI units are regarded as the standard.

,D8358-21,Standard Guide for Assessment and Inclusion of Wall Deposits in the Analysis of  Single-Stage Samplers for Airborne Particulate Matter,"Significance and Use  5.1 The following is a non-exclusive list of standards to which this guide applies: Guide D6062 ; Test Methods D4185 , D4532 , D6785 , D7035 , D7439 , D7948 ; and Practices D6061 and D6552 .   5.2 The applicability of this guide to other standards under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee D22, but not the direct responsibility of Subcommittee D22.04, should be considered where analyte entry into the sampler is considered the sample and where analyte adherence to internal sampler surfaces (“walls”) is likely to scavenge analyte from the collection substrate.   5.3 Aerosol samplers typically consist of a filter or other collection substrate, for example an impaction plate or foam, supported in a container or holder. The entire device typically is considered an aerosol sampler. The sampling efficiency of the aerosol sampler, that is, the ratio of the concentration collected by the collection substrate to the undisturbed concentration in the air, has three components: ( 1 ) aspiration (or entry) efficiency; ( 2 ) transport efficiency (depending on design, both from entry “plane” to internal separator and from any internal separator to collection substrate); and ( 3 ) penetration (through the internal separator). For a sampler of a specific design, the three efficiency components are functions of particle (aerodynamic) size and flow rate. The aspiration efficiency also depends on wind speed and direction, while the sampler’s angle to the vertical influences both the aspiration efficiency and the transport efficiency. Ideally, when a sampler is designed and tested for its sampling performance, or both, it should first be established what is considered as the collected sample (that is, the deposit on the collection substrate, but also any deposits on any internal surfaces if these are to be analysed).   5.4 Part of the aerosol entering a sampler will deposit on the internal surfaces of the sampler prior to reaching the collection substrate. There are number of mechanisms by which this can occur, including bounce from the filter, inertial impaction, gravitational settling and electrostatic attraction after entry. In addition, after sample collection, if the collection substrate is transported while mounted in the sampler, it is possible that particles originally deposited on the collection substrate may dislodge during transportation. Such particles can thereby contribute to deposits on the walls, as well as on the base of any cover plate or plug. All particles found elsewhere than on or in the collection substrate are often loosely termed “wall deposits.” If the sample of interest entails the entire aspirated air particulate into the container or holder (sampler), it is necessary to account for these wall deposits, especially if it cannot be shown that they should be disregarded.   5.5 The research underpinning the information in this guide has arisen partly from studies of inert particles ( 3 , 4 ) , but mostly from investigations of methods for the determination of airborne metalliferous particulates ( 2 , 5- 15 ) . However, the issues at hand are also important in sampling airborne organic materials, including bacterial endotoxin ( 16 ) , wood ( 17 ) , and pharmaceutical dusts ( 18 ) ; another relevant study reported results from investigations in thermosetting plastics, wood, paper, and animal breeding ( 19 ) . Except in the case of very large wood dust particles, there is no evidence to suggest that wall deposited particles are sufficiently different from those found on the collection substrate to warrant their exclusion ( 13 , 14 ) . Wall deposits are not limited to aerosol samplers for larger airborne particles but may also be found in samplers for finer particles ( 20 , 21 ) . There may be a justification for excluding wall deposits where the performance of an aerosol sampler tested to EN 13205 shows appropriate compliance with the relevant ISO 7708 size-selective convention without their inclusion.   5.6 The findings of studies that have been carried out to assess wall deposits in two commonly used samplers are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 . A commonly used sampler, the 37-mm closed-face polystyrene cassette (CFC), is specified as the sampler of choice in many U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) methods ( 1 ) . While the specific methods may not explicitly call for the recovery and analysis of CFC wall deposits, inclusion of wall deposits is called for by both agencies ( 22 ) . Another widely used sampler, the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) personal inhalable sampler, was specifically developed for the purpose of collecting the inhalable fraction of aerosol in accordance with ISO 7708 specifications ( 23 ) . Wall deposits in this sampler were noted during its development and are specifically included as part of the sample ( 24 ) , although no standard protocol has been published for their inclusion other than for gravimetric analysis. Side-by-side studies have shown little difference between these two samplers when used to collect aerosol in metals industries ( 12 ) , provided they are analyzed by the same procedure (that is, filter only or filter plus wall deposits). Fewer studies have been carried out in non-metal industries. However, in the study of sewage composting facilities ( 16 ) , wall deposits of endotoxin exceeded 40 % of the total sample in 34 % of cassettes and exceeded more than half the total sample in some. In the laboratory study of wood dust ( 17 ) 85 % of the sample aspirated was found on the cassette walls. In the pharmaceutical industry study ( 18 ) , averages of 51 %, 62 %, and 72 % of the sample was found on non-filter internal surfaces, depending on compound. Figure 8.2 of Aitken and Donaldson ( 3 ) provides a graph of mass faction wall deposits of inert particles in the IOM sampler versus particle size. Although the actual data points are not provided the median is approximately 18 % and the maximum approximately 55 %, in accordance with the data in Table 2 . Witschger, et al., ( 4 ) provides similar data, with a maximum wall deposit of 50 %. While both these studies were performed in a laboratory, Lidén, et al., ( 19 ) presents averages of 24–37 % wall deposits in a range of field samples from non-metal industries, depending on industry.     5.7 The Gesamtsstaubprobenhame (GSP) inhalable sampler, and similar metal or plastic versions referred to as a conical inhalable sampler (CIS), has not been the subject of similar extensive investigations of wall deposits. While the GSP met the inhalable convention in a European study without considering wall deposits for particles up to 25 µm AED ( 25 ) , for particles up 50 µm AED it under-samples by an average of 21 % with respect to the IOM sampler (when wall deposits are considered in the IOM sampler) ( 26 ) . A study of wall deposits at a lead mine concentrate mill ( 5 ) showed up to 40 % (median 24 %) of total aspiration on the walls, while the laboratory wood study ( 17 ) found an average of 42 %, suggesting that wall deposits be considered with this sampler. Other samplers not specified in this practice may also have wall deposits; these should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.   5.8 No pattern has been discerned that might allow for correction factors to be used in any single sampler without introducing too great an uncertainty into the result ( 1 , 12 ) ). Therefore, it is necessary to account for the wall deposits in all cases where the sample is meant to include the total aspirated aerosol into the sampler. On the other hand, enough data have now been accumulated to allow rough assumptions to be made regarding the effect of wall deposits on a large population of samples, either historically or for predictive purposes, including estimating the proportion of likely overexposures. These estimates become more precise where there is a body of data involving filter-only and filter plus wall deposits from the specific environment of interest.   5.9 Samplers for the ISO 7708 respirable fraction of dust have filters contained in holders downstream of (after) the size-separation device, typically a cyclone. These sample holders, where not electrically conductive, have also been shown to exhibit significant proportions of wall deposits. In a study of field samples ( 19 ) , up to 32 % of total collected quartz was found on the walls of 2-piece non-conductive styrene cassettes and up to 55 % on the walls of 3-piece styrene non-conductive cassettes, which is similar to what was found in laboratory studies ( 20 ) . Scope  1.1 Many methods for sampling airborne particulate matter entail aerosol collection on a substrate (typically a filter) housed within a container (or holder), the whole apparatus being referred to as an aerosol sampler. In operation, the sampler allows a vacuum (pressure below ambient or room air pressure) to be applied to the rear of the substrate so that sampled air will pass through the substrate, leaving collected particles on the substrate for subsequent analysis. The sampler may also protect the substrate, while the opening (orifice) of the container may further play some role in determining what size range(s) of particles approach the collection substrate (size-selective sampling).   1.2 All particles entering the container orifice are considered part of the sample, unless stated otherwise in the method, but not all particles are necessarily found on the substrate after sampling ( 1 ) . 2 Particles may be deposited on the inner walls of the sampler during sampling or may be deposited on the inside walls of the sampler or on the orifice plug or cap following transportation ( 2 ) . These particles are often loosely referred to as wall deposits. This guide presents background on the importance of these wall deposits and offers procedures by which these deposits can be assessed and included in the sample.   1.3 Wall deposits may also occur in multi-stage samplers (for example, cascade impactors), but this guide does not cover such samplers.   1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.6  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,F2704-17a,Standard Specification for  Air-Fed Protective Ensembles,"Significance and Use   4.1 As with other hazardous materials protective ensembles, air-fed protective ensembles include clothing and equipment items needed for dermal and respiratory protection, including protective suits, gloves, footwear, and eye/face protection. Unlike other protective ensembles, air-fed protective ensembles do not use separate respiratory protective devices such as self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or non-powered air-purifying respirators (APRs).   4.1.1 Those types of respirators normally have a tight-fitting face piece that provides inhalation hazard protection and dermal exposure protection to the face, eyes, nose, and mouth.   4.1.2 Air-fed protective ensembles are worn without the use of a separate respirator. The entire suit serves as the respiratory protective device and also provides dermal exposure protection. The wearer breathes supplied air or filtered air pumped into the protective suit.   4.2 Air-fed protective ensembles are used to protect workers in a number of applications.   4.2.1 These include, but are not limited to: chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, remediation of hazardous materials sites, use against highly infectious biological agents in Biosafety Level 4 laboratories, and for protection of workers involved in nuclear and radiological facilities, where it is possible radioactive particles will be encountered.   4.3 The requirements of this specification have been partly based on the NFPA 1991 and NFPA 1994 standards, which establish criteria for vapor-protective ensembles used in hazardous materials emergencies. NFPA 1991 establishes requirements for a protective ensemble that encapsulates the wearer and the breathing apparatus. NFPA 1994 establishes requirements for a protective ensemble under Class 1 requirements that in some configurations encapsulates the wearer and the breathing apparatus.   4.3.1 In this specification, a breathing apparatus is not worn inside the suit, but instead breathing air is connected to the suit either via an external air line or respiratory protective equipment that is externally connected to the suit wall. Extensive criteria for the integrity of the overall ensemble are applied through design and performance requirements. This allows for different configurations of a protective ensemble that incorporates a hooded visor, protective gloves, protective footwear, and the respiratory protective equipment.   4.4 The qualification of the respiratory protective equipment is addressed by the applicable requirements for respirators established in 42 CFR Part 84. As such, the entire air-fed ensemble is subject to certification by NIOSH in addition to meeting the requirements in this specification.   4.5 This specification establishes classifications for the protective ensemble. The classifications include one that is determined by the configuration of the protective ensemble and one that concerns the use of the protective ensemble.   4.5.1 A protective ensemble can be classified as an “air line protective ensemble” or a “PAPR-based air-fed protective ensemble.” Under each of these classifications, protective ensembles can be further classified as “limited use” and “multiple use.”   4.5.2 These classifications account for differences in the configuration of the air supply and material strength and durability. These classifications do not account for the decontamination effectiveness of multiple-use ensembles.   4.6 In recognition of the potential diverse applications to which the protective ensemble can be used, documentation requirements are provided for manufacturers to base claims for permeation resistance of ensemble materials against specific chemicals or for claims of ensemble material performance against blood-borne (or liquid-borne) pathogens. Similar requirements are established for the respiratory protective equipment, when this equipment is based on the use of filters, cartridges, or canisters.   4.7 The requirements in the certification section are based on the recommendations provided for conformity assessment example category B in Annex A2 of Guide F3050 . This category specifies that the supplier provides a declaration of conformity with testing conducted at an independent laboratory that is accredited to ISO 17025 and manufacturer quality management system that is registered to ISO 9001 with the appropriate scope for air-fed ensembles, and with manufacturer/supplier periodic monitoring of continuing conformity. The manufacturer is permitted to exceed these requirements. Scope   1.1 This specification establishes design, performance, classification, documentation, labeling, and certification requirements for protective ensembles that deliver air to the wearer by means of an air line or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR).   1.2 As a prerequisite to this specification, regulations within Title 42 Federal Code of Regulations, Part 84 are used to establish the conformance of the air-fed protective ensemble to respiratory protection requirements.   1.3 This specification addresses protective ensembles used for environments involving chemical, biological, and radiological/nuclear particulate hazards.   1.4 This specification sets specific criteria for air-fed protective ensembles used to prevent exposure to substances such as, but not limited to, chemical hazards, infectious microorganisms requiring Biosafety Level 4 (BLS4) protection, and environments where it is possible radiological or nuclear particulates will be found.   1.5 This specification is further used for classification of the protective ensemble as limited use or multiple use.   1.6 The values stated in SI units or in other units shall be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in each system must be used independently of the other, without combining values in any way.   1.7  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.8  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,D5391-23,Standard Test Method for  Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity of a Flowing High Purity  Water Sample,"Significance and Use  5.1 Conductivity measurements are typically made on samples of moderate to high ionic strength where contamination of open samples in routine laboratory handling is negligible. Under those conditions, standard temperature compensation using coefficients of 1 to 3 % of reading per degree Celsius over wide concentration ranges is appropriate. In contrast, this test method requires special considerations to reduce trace contamination and accommodates the high and variable temperature coefficients of pure water samples that can range as high as 7 % of reading per degree Celsius. In addition, measuring instrument design performance must be proven under high purity conditions.   5.2 This test method is applicable for detecting trace amounts of ionic contaminants in water. It is the primary means of monitoring the performance of demineralization and other high purity water treatment operations. It is also used to detect ionic contamination in boiler waters, microelectronics rinse waters, pharmaceutical process waters, etc., as well as to monitor and control the level of boiler and power plant cycle chemistry treatment chemicals. This test method supplements the basic measurement requirements for Test Methods D1125 , D2186 , and D4519 .   5.3 At very low levels of alkaline contamination, for example, 0–1 μg/L NaOH, conductivity is suppressed, and can actually be slightly below the theoretical value for pure water. ( 1 and 2 ) 4 Alkaline materials suppress the highly conductive hydrogen ion concentration while replacing it with less conductive sodium and hydroxide ions. This phenomenon is not an interference with conductivity or resistivity measurement itself but could give misleading indications of inferred water purity in this range if it is not recognized. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of electrical conductivity and resistivity of high purity water samples below 10 μS/cm (above 0.1 Mohm-cm). It is applicable to both continuous and periodic measurements but in all cases, the water must be flowing in order to provide representative sampling. Static grab sampling cannot be used for such high purity water. Continuous measurements are made directly in pure water process lines, or in side stream sample lines to enable measurements on high temperature or high pressure samples, or both.   1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.   1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.4  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

,E2709-23,Standard Practice for  Demonstrating Capability to Comply with an Acceptance Procedure,"Significance and Use  4.1 This practice considers inspection procedures that may involve multiple-stage sampling, where at each stage one can decide to accept or to continue sampling, and the decision to reject is deferred until the last stage.   4.1.1 At each stage there are one or more acceptance criteria on the test results; for example, limits on each individual test result, or limits on statistics based on the sample of test results, such as the average, standard deviation, or coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation).   4.2 The methodology in this practice defines an acceptance region for a set of test results from the sampled population such that, at a prescribed confidence level, the probability that a sample from the population will pass the acceptance procedure is greater than or equal to a prespecified lower bound.   4.2.1 Having test results fall in the acceptance region is not equivalent to passing the acceptance procedure, but provides assurance that a sample would pass the acceptance procedure with a specified probability.   4.2.2 This information can be used for process demonstration, validation of test methods, and qualification of instruments, processes, and materials.   4.2.3 This information can be used for lot release (acceptance), but the lower bound may be conservative in some cases.   4.2.4 If the results are to be applied to future test results from the same process, then it is assumed that the process is stable and predictable. If this is not the case then there can be no guarantee that the probability estimates would be valid predictions of future process performance.   4.3 This methodology was originally developed ( 1- 4 ) 3 for use in two specific quality characteristics of drug products in the pharmaceutical industry but will be applicable for acceptance procedures in all industries.   4.4 Mathematical derivations would be required that are specific to the individual criteria of each test. Abstract This practice provides a general methodology for evaluating single-stage or multiple-stage acceptance procedures which involve a quality characteristic measured on a numerical scale. This methodology computes, at a prescribed confidence level, a lower bound on the probability of passing an acceptance procedure, using estimates of the parameters of the distribution of test results from a sampled population. Scope  1.1 This practice provides a general methodology for evaluating single-stage or multiple-stage acceptance procedures which involve a quality characteristic measured on a numerical scale. This methodology computes, at a prescribed confidence level, a lower bound on the probability of passing an acceptance procedure, using estimates of the parameters of the distribution of test results from a sampled population.   1.2 For a prescribed lower probability bound, the methodology can also generate an acceptance limit table, which defines a set of test method outcomes (for example, sample averages and standard deviations) that would pass the acceptance procedure at a prescribed confidence level.   1.3 This approach may be used for demonstrating compliance with in-process, validation, or lot-release specifications.   1.4 The system of units for this practice is not specified.   1.5  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,D156-23,Standard Test Method for Saybolt Color of Petroleum Products (Saybolt Chromometer Method),"Significance and Use  5.1 Determination of the color of petroleum products is used mainly for manufacturing control purposes and is an important quality characteristic since color is readily observed by the user of the product. In some cases the color may serve as an indication of the degree of refinement of the material. When the color range of a particular product is known, a variation outside the established range can indicate possible contamination with another product. However, color is not always a reliable guide to product quality and should not be used indiscriminately in product specifications. Scope  1.1 This test method covers the determination of the color of refined oils such as undyed motor and aviation gasoline, jet propulsion fuels, naphthas and kerosine, and, in addition, petroleum waxes and pharmaceutical white oils.  Note 1:  For determining the color of petroleum products darker than Saybolt Color − 16, see Test Method D1500 .   1.2 This test method reports results specific to this test method and recorded as, “Saybolt Color units.”   1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units or in SI units and which are not in parentheses are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only.  Note 2:  Oil tubes and apparatus used in this test method have traditionally been marked in inches, (the tube is required to be etched with 1 / 8 in. divisions.) The Saybolt Color Numbers are aligned with inch, 1 / 2 in., 1 / 4 in., and 1 / 8 in. changes in the depth of oil. These fractional inch changes do not readily correspond to SI equivalents and in view of the preponderance of apparatus already in use and marked in inches, the inch/pound unit is regarded as the standard. However the test method does use SI units of length when the length is not directly related to divisions on the oil tube and Saybolt Color Numbers. The test method uses SI units for temperature.   1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

,E3326-22,Standard Guide for Application of Continuous Manufacturing (BioCM) in the Biopharmaceutical  Industry,"Significance and Use  4.1 This guide focuses on upstream and downstream processes for biopharmaceutical products with a particular focus on antibody production processes. For further information, see Appendix X1 and Refs ( 1- 3 ) .   4.2 Bioprocesses traditionally consist of discrete unit operations labeled as upstream, downstream, and fill/finish operations. The objectives at each stage are significantly different, as are the operating parameters and control processes, that can make complete integration impractical initially ( Appendix X1 ). This guide does not imply that complete integration is a prerequisite. A higher degree of integration may be possible over time as a better understanding of the dynamics of processes become established.   4.2.1  Upstream Processes— The purpose of upstream processes is to generate sufficient product to meet patient requirements preferably in the fewest number of batches. This starts with increasing biomass (cell-line expansion from working cell bank to production inoculation) to a production bioreactor in which the focus shifts to producing product. The material within a bioreactor during extended growth is heterogenous, for example, cells will differ in age, there may be genetic drift, secreted product can differ in the residence time spent in the bioreactor, and cell debris accumulates throughout the process.   4.2.2  Downstream Processes— The purpose of downstream processes is to harvest product and purify it from process- and product-related impurities (for example, cell debris, nucleic acids, and misfolds) to the desired level. Solids are first separated from solutes; solutes are then separated from each other in the process of purification. Certain processes may at best be semi-continuous, and some steps may be prone to fouling, which may require manual intervention.   4.2.3  Fill/Finish Operations— The purpose of fill/finish operations is to formulate the purified product in a form that ensures stability and sterility and provides a dosage form consistent with the desired product profile. Operations may also include inclusion in a delivery system as a combination product. In this guide, operations up to and including final bulk fill for final drugs substance are addressed. Fill/finish operations for drug product and combination products are out of scope for this guide.   4.3 This guide does not advocate the following:   4.3.1 CM is suitable for the manufacture of all biopharmaceutical products and processes;   4.3.2 Guidance on issues related to the safe operation of a CM process or continuous biomanufacturing equipment. It is the responsibility of the user of this guide to establish appropriate health and safety practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before use; and   4.3.3 Specific designs or operating regimes for CM. Scope  1.1 This guide is intended as a complement to Guide E2968 . It provides key concepts and principles to assist in the appropriate selection, development, and operation of continuous processing technologies for the manufacture of biologically derived products.   1.2 Several of the principles covered in Guide E2968 are applicable to biomanufacturing. However, processes for biologically derived products differ from those for synthetic drugs in a number of fundamental ways in addition to their source (for example, format: aqueous liquids versus powders; scope: genesis to final formulation). This guide is intended to provide greater clarity for biomanufacturing. It does not imply that topics in Guide E2968 that are not covered here do not apply to continuous manufacturing (CM) for biologics.   1.3 Biologically derived products also differ widely from each other in terms of modalities, source materials, and the manufacturing technologies used, not all of which are equally amenable to operating in a continuous mode.   1.4 Opportunities do exist for the introduction of continuous technologies, for example, efforts are ongoing to adapt processes for large-scale manufacture of broadly applicable modalities such as monoclonal antibodies to a continuous format. This guide is intended to provide guidance to the design and implementation of antibody processes.   1.5 The principles can be applicable to unit operations or processes or both for other modalities but may not be applicable to all bioprocesses.   1.6 Particular consideration should be given to the development and application of the appropriate scientific understanding and engineering principles that differentiate CM from traditional batch manufacturing.   1.7 Since much of the processing is done under conditions amenable to microbial growth, maintaining process streams free from external biological impurities and microbial contamination (for example, bioburden, viruses, and mycoplasma) is critical.   1.8 This guide is intended to apply in both the development of a new process or the redesign of an existing one.   1.9 A manufacturer may choose to implement continuous manufacturing for discrete unit operations in stages as they develop process understanding before implementing a fully connected or continuous manufacturing process.   1.10  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard.

These products are also manufactured under the FDA and other federal agency regulations.  These guidelines include the layout of facilities, design of containment areas, ventilation and air quality, personnel areas, special processing hazards, controlled environment areas, and other items.  This guide is for use by engineers, architects, and owners of biopharmatechnical manufacturing facilities to consider the special factors in laying out the facilities to meet cGMP requirements and other good engineering principles.  By using these guidelines along with other design criteria required by a variety of regulatory agencies, a validation effort can be achieved more easily to meet agency requirements and obtain operating permits.  This guide is intended to provide general guidelines for consideration and application in a variety of plant operations and processes in which the designers can make specific decisions concerning the exact architectural design features to use. Scope 1.1 This guide covers architectural design considerations for buildings and facilities used in the biological processing industry to make drugs, chemicals, and other products.  1.2 These designs are intended to meet current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) criteria and guidelines published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for processes and products manufactured under CFR Title 21.  1.3 While the guidelines described are general in nature, they are not expected to apply to all of the possible biotechnical processes used in the industry today. Accordingly, the user of this guide must exercise good engineering judgment in specific design applications to select the proper guidelines that apply.  1.4 In addition to the cGMP guidelines provided herein, other regulations and guides should be considered that are promulgated by other federal agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Drug Administration (USDA), the National Institute of Health (NIH), and so forth.  1.5 While the buildings will be designed to meet specific functional requirements and comply with local zoning ordinances, building codes, handicapped employee standards, and so forth, these considerations are not included in this guide.  1.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard.  1.7 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety problems, if any, associated with its use.

,E3060-23,Standard Guide for Subvisible Particle Measurement in Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing  Using Dynamic (Flow) Imaging Microscopy,"Significance and Use  4.1 This guide will encompass considerations for manufacturers regarding sources and potential causes of subvisible particles in biomanufacturing operations and the use of dynamic imaging particle analyzers as a suggested common method to monitor them. The guide will address the following components of particle analysis using dynamic imaging microscopy: fundamental principles, operation, image analysis methods, sample handling, instrument calibration, and data reporting. Scope  1.1 Biotherapeutic drugs and vaccines are susceptible to inherent protein aggregate formation which may change over the product shelf life. Intrinsic particles, including excipients, silicone oil, and other particles from the process, container/closures, equipment or delivery devices, and extrinsic particles which originate from sources outside of the contained process, may also be present. Monitoring and identifying the source of the subvisible particles throughout the product life cycle (from initial characterization and formulation through finished product expiry) can optimize product development, process design, improve process control, improve the manufacturing process, and ensure lot-to-lot consistency.   1.2 Understanding the nature of particles and their source is a key to the ability to take actions to adjust the manufacturing process to ensure final product quality. Dynamic imaging microscopy (also known as flow imaging or flow microscopy) is a useful technique for particle analysis and characterization (proteinaceous and other types) during product development, in-process and commercial release with a sensitive detection and characterization of subvisible particles at ≥ 2 µm and ≤ 100 µm (although smaller and larger particles may also be reported if data are available). In this technique brightfield illumination is used to capture images either directly in a process stream, or as a continuous sample stream passes through a flow cell positioned in the field of view of an imaging system. An algorithm performs a particle detection routine. This process is a key step during dynamic imaging. The digital particle images in the sample are processed by image morphology analysis software that quantifies the particles in size, count, image intensity, and morphological parameters. Dynamic imaging particle analyzers can produce direct determinations of the particle count per unit volume (that is, particle concentration), as a function of particle size by dividing the particle count by the volume of imaged fluid (see Appendix X1 ).   1.3 This guide will describe best practices and considerations in applying dynamic imaging to identification of potential sources and causes of particles during biomanufacturing. These results can be used to monitor these particles and where possible, to adjust the manufacturing process to avoid their formation. This guide will also address the fundamental principles of dynamic imaging analysis including image analysis methods, sample preparation, instrument calibration and verification and data reporting.   1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

Additionally, the low pH step is performed on a cell-free intermediate, post initial capture using protein A chromatography.   1.4 The 5 log10 inactivation of murine retrovirus claimed by using this practice will be utilized in conjunction with other clearance unit operations (for example, chromatography and virus retentive filtration) to assure sufficient total process clearance of murine retroviruses, which will be supportive of early phase regulatory filings.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E3251-23,Standard Test Method for Microbial Ingress Testing on Single-Use Systems,"Significance and Use  4.1 Single-use systems (SUSs) used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing must maintain sterility and product quality of the fluid inside. Such articles or systems should therefore be validated as providing an effective barrier against microbial ingress. The microbial barrier properties of a SUS may be demonstrated using deterministic physical tests that have been correlated to microbial integrity. Such physical test methods are described in Test Method E3336 . Two microbial test methods (aerosol exposure and immersion exposure) are described in this test method that can be used to demonstrate microbial integrity of a SUS or determine the MALL, the maximum defect size that does not allow microbial ingress, into a SUS.   4.2 It is important to note that the results of microbial ingress tests are heavily dependent on the conditions under which the test is performed and are not suitable for routine checking of a SUS due to the test’s destructive nature.   4.2.1 Any size defect may be forced to fail under sufficiently aggressive conditions (including a large enough sample size, high differential pressure, or high hydrostatic pressure, for example) that would not ordinarily reflect normal use conditions. Thus, it is necessary to clearly define the relevant conditions for a test through a risk assessment of both the actual SUS claims and its final use (Practice E3244 ). Once that is established, the size of defect that can be detected under those conditions can be determined, if required, using defined defects.   4.2.2 “Relevant conditions” refers to worse-case actual use conditions but does not mean that a SUS must be tested under theoretically absolute (extreme) “worst-case” conditions.   4.2.3 Testing may be performed on individual components or entire systems. Considerations for defining “relevant conditions” and testing design should be based on a risk assessment for the SUS intended use and should include:  4.2.3.1 A channel created by a defect or breach through the film thickness or through a seam or connection which must be filled with liquid to allow microbial passage. 5 , 6  4.2.3.2 Factors that could influence liquid filling of a channel, including a liquid’s viscosity, defect size and type, plastic materials and pressure applied inside the SUS.  4.2.3.3 Rationale for selecting a defect type should be based on the probable type of defect(s) that could occur during the SUS life cycle  4.2.3.4 Rationale for selection of defect sizes should be based on a deterministic physical testing method (detection limit)  4.2.3.5 Consideration of pressure(s) differential applied during testing to simulate conditions that a SUS may be subjected to during actual use conditions (Practice E3244 ).   4.3 The selection of challenge microorganism and minimum target challenge concentration should be based on a risk assessment, justified, and validated, as necessary, for the limit of detection. A minimum of 10 6 CFU/cm 2 surface area (aerosol) or 10 6 CFU/mL (liquid immersion) is typically used (ISO 15747 and Aliaskarisohi 7 ).   4.4 SUS test articles bearing calibrated defects may be produced and tested to allow either the determination of the minimum defect size that can be detected by a microbial test method under given conditions (for example, microbial ingress) or to determine the MALL of SUSs under use-case conditions (for example, aerosol test).   4.4.1 If the test objective is to determine the MALL and demonstrate correlation between physical integrity test sensitivity and microbial ingress, selection of the calibrated defect (laser-drilled hole, capillary, copper wire) should be based on the most probable type of defect that could occur during the SUS’s life cycle.   4.4.2 The selection of defect sizes should be based on the expected transition from ingress to no ingress under the SUS’s intended use-case conditions, alternatively, worst-case conditions can be selected. As described in the Practice E3244 , a typical range is from 1 µm to 100 µm. The defect sizes should be calibrated by a defined method.   4.4.3 One approach for determining the MALL of a SUS film material is to test single-use film coupons with calibrated defects, in holders. This enables higher throughput testing; however, using coupons as test articles may not represent a scale-down model of an entire SUS.   4.4.4 Another approach is to validate the test method on alternative container-like vials. The principle remains the same. The alternative container must be able to hold the minimum size defect.   4.5 These procedures should be conducted in a microbiological laboratory by trained personnel. It is assumed that basic microbiological equipment and supplies for conducting routine microbiological manipulations (for example, standard plate counts, autoclave sterilization, etc.) are available. Scope  1.1 The microbial test method outlined in this test method applies to microbial ingress risk assessment of a single-use system (SUS) or its individual components that require integrity testing either by the assembly supplier or the end user of the assembly based on a potential risk of a breach to the product or manufacturing process.   1.2 The aim of microbial ingress testing of sterile SUSs used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing is two-fold:   1.2.1 Firstly, it is used to evaluate the ability of a SUS fluid path to remain sterile after a SUS has been challenged by microbial exposure. Microbial exposure is achieved either by directly placing a SUS into a container of microbial challenge solution, or by delivering an aerosolized microbial challenge onto a SUS that is placed inside a test chamber designed to generate and deliver the aerosol. The choice of the test challenge organism should be justified based on a risk assessment of the SUS and conditions of use.   1.2.2 Additionally, microbial ingress testing can be used to determine the maximum allowable leakage limit (MALL) that does not allow microbial ingress under specific test conditions. The defect size that can be detected by specific physical integrity testing methods (see Test Method E3336 ) can be correlated to this MALL in order to claim microbial integrity. Test articles bearing calibrated defects over a range of dimensions, including up to a defect size expected to consistently allow microbial ingress as a positive control (defect-based positive control), may be tested to determine the MALL.   1.3 Both purposes for microbial ingress testing as described in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 can either be conducted by liquid immersion or aerosol exposure. For the purpose described in 1.2.2 , the type of exposure should be determined according to the SUS’s use-case conditions and a risk assessment.   1.4 The method used to create a breach, hole or defect in single-use film or in a SUS test article, as well as the analytical method used to physically characterize the defect size is outside of the scope of this test method. The sampling plan for a given test article should be justified with the rationale of sampling size to obtain a statistically meaningful effect (Practice E3244 ). Determining the appropriate number of SUS test articles will depend on a risk assessment of the SUS and the conditions of its use and is also outside of this test method’s scope.   1.5  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E3259-22,Standard Practice for Process to Remove Retroviruses by Small Virus Retentive Filters,"Significance and Use  3.1 Mammalian cell lines are widely used in the production of biological therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins. Some of these cell lines, like rodent cell lines, are known to contain genes encoding endogenous retroviral-like particles or produce endogenous retrovirus, but there is no evidence of an association between rodent retrovirus and disease in humans. Adventitious viruses can be introduced into a drug substance manufacturing process from other sources, and contamination of human therapeutics is a safety concern ( 3 ) .   3.2 Virus filtration, an orthogonal technology in a virus clearance platform to such steps as low pH or surfactant inactivation, has traditionally been accepted as a robust method for virus clearance when well designed. Size exclusion has been shown to be the primary mechanism of virus removal by virus retentive filtration, that is, larger viruses are more easily retained than smaller viruses such as parvoviruses ( 4 , 5 ) . Large virus retention has also been shown to be insensitive to process fluid characteristics such as protein type, protein concentration, pH, and ionic strength ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) . In contrast, for small viruses, aspects like flow pausing and/or flux decay can impact clearance ( 4 , 6 , 11 ) .   3.3 Large virus retentive filters, or retrovirus filters, are tested for removal of larger enveloped viruses like retrovirus or MuLV (80 nm to 100 nm) and have undetectable levels of the large bacteriophage PR772 (64 nm to 82 nm) ( 1 ) . Small virus retentive filters, or parvovirus filters, are designed to remove parvovirus, like MMV (18 nm to 26 nm) ( 1 ) . Since size exclusion has been demonstrated as the mechanism of virus retention, retroviruses, which are three to four times larger than parvoviruses, should be large enough to be completely retained, with undetectable levels of retrovirus in the filtrate, by all small virus retentive filters designed to remove parvovirus.   3.4 Numerous published studies and reviews encompassing data from the last 20 years have shown both large and small virus retentive filters are effective and consistent for removal of retrovirus. In published reviews of regulatory submissions from 1990 through 2010, rare occurrences of retrovirus breakthrough did occur across both large and small virus retentive filters. These anomalies, however, were not resolved and could be attributed to study design, experimental artifacts, or limitations of the meta-analyses performed on the regulatory submission ( 12 ) . In a summary of 89 submissions to Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), processes using either large or small virus retentive filters showed no detection of any infectious particles from large viruses ( 12 ) . A collection of viral filtration results across eight biopharmaceutical companies showed no large virus breakthrough across any small virus retentive filter for all 198 experiments reviewed ( 7 ) . Additionally, a recent review of 20 plus years of small virus retentive filter experiments from two viral clearance testing houses showed only 0.61 % (14 out of 2311 experiments) viral filtration studies performed with larger viruses had detectable, replicated virus ( 10 ) . This manuscript further suggests that all positive results were not due to viral breakthrough of integral small virus retentive filters, but rather to other causes that included virus detection assay, aerosolization of virus during filtration, splashes, spills, or potential use of non-integral laboratory scale filters.   3.5 The level of justifiable LRV for a modular claim from a censored dataset, that is, all observations are below a certain LRV level, can be difficult to estimate ( 13 ) , and is almost always an underestimation of an actual value. LRV approximations from censored data are influenced by viral spike volume, viral spike titer, load volume, and assay sensitivities to product matrices, in addition to small virus retentive filter performance. In the Mattila review, where no large virus was detected in 198 experiments, small virus retentive filters showed an average clearance >5.86 LRV ±0.91 for Reo3, a medium-sized virus (60 nm to 80 nm), suggesting at least equal or better clearance for the larger retrovirus, MuLV ( 7 ) . For creation of modular claim from censored values, Stuckey, et al. proposed that the highest LRV in set of censored data could be used for a modular claim ( 6 ) . In these experiments, load material spiked with both parvovirus and retrovirus was used to challenge small virus retentive filters. Parvovirus breakthrough was observed but no retrovirus breakthrough was detected, further supporting both a size exclusion-based mechanism of virus retention and the robustness of retrovirus retention using small virus retentive filters ( 6 ) . Additionally, even large virus retentive filters, designed to retain larger viruses and having on average larger pore sizes than small virus retentive filters, are classified as having the ability to retain >6 logs of PR772, a 64 nm to 82 nm bacteriophage often used as a surrogate for retrovirus, in virus filtration studies ( 1 , 14 ) . These large virus filters have been shown to clear >8 logs of PR772 ( 15 ) , and by definition clear more than 6 log 10 of retrovirus ( 12 ) . These published data, collectively, support a modular claim for small virus retentive filters of >6.0 LRV for retrovirus (MuLV).   3.6 Implementing parameters of small virus retentive filtration established by this practice can provide robust retrovirus removal and can be used as a modular retrovirus validation of the virus filtration step. In conjunction with other clearance unit operations (for example, chromatography and inactivation by pH or surfactants), sufficient overall retrovirus clearance can be achieved ( 3 ) . Scope  1.1 This practice assures 6.0 log 10 removal of retrovirus (for example, MuLV).   1.2 This practice is applicable to monoclonal antibody (mAb), immunoglobulin G (IgG) fusion proteins, recombinant proteins, or other proteins produced using mammalian cell lines (for example, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), murine hybridomas, murine myelomas, or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293).   1.3 The step is performed on cell-free intermediates.   1.4 The log removal claim for retrovirus by small virus retentive filters can be used in conjunction with other clearance unit operations (for example, low pH inactivation, or inactivation of virus by surfactant) to assure sufficient total process clearance of potential virus contaminants, which would be supportive of early phase (clinical phase 1 or phase 2a trials) regulatory filings.   1.5 Retrovirus removal claim by filtration is limited to small virus retentive filters, as defined in the PDA Technical Report Virus Filtration ( 1 ) 2 in the context of this standard.   1.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E3042-16(2024),Standard Practice for Process Step to Inactivate Rodent Retrovirus with Triton X-100  Treatment<rangeref></rangeref  >,"Significance and Use  3.1 Rodent-derived cell lines are widely used in the production of biopharmaceutical drugs such as mAbs and Fc fusion proteins. These cell lines have been shown to contain genes encoding endogenous retroviral-like particles or endogenous retrovirus. Despite the lack of evidence for an association between such rodent retroviruses and disease in humans, the potential contamination of human therapeutics raises safety concerns for biopharmaceutical drugs. Additionally, adventitious agents such as viruses can be introduced into a biopharmaceutical drug substance manufacturing process from other sources, and potential safety issues can be attributed to these potential unknowns. For these reasons, effective viral clearance is an essential aspect of an integrated approach combining safety testing and process characterization which ensures virus safety for biopharmaceutical drug products made using rodent cell lines.   3.2 Solvent/detergent inactivation has been widely used for decades to inactivate enveloped viruses in blood plasma derived biopharmaceutical therapies ( 1- 3 ) . 3 Solvent/detergent systems using the detergents Triton X-100 or Polysorbate 80 along with the organic solvent tri(n-butyl)phosphate (TNBP) have been used to inactivate enveloped viruses by disrupting the viral envelope thereby reducing the ability of the enveloped virus to attach to and then infect the host cell ( 4 and 5 ) .   3.3 Most manufacturers of mAbs, recombinant proteins, and Fc fusion proteins have focused on viral inactivation methods using the detergent Triton X-100 or Polysorbate 80 in the absence of TNBP ( 6 ) , which can interfere with subsequent bioprocessing steps. The ability of the detergents alone to inactivate retroviruses has been demonstrated in monoclonal antibodies produced in rodent-derived cell lines ( 6- 9 ) . At a 2011 workshop devoted to viral clearance steps used in bioprocessing ( 7 ) , investigators from one firm showed incubation with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 60 min of hold time at ambient temperature inactivated >5 log 10 of X-MuLV across four separate mAbs in cell culture matrices.   3.3.1 At the same 2011 workshop ( 7 ) , investigators from a second firm confirmed that levels of protein concentration and lipid concentration had no observable effect on MuLV virus inactivation at levels of 0.3 % Triton X-100. Additionally, eight different monoclonal antibody Host Cell Culture Fluids (HCCF), were treated with 0.3 % Triton X-100 for a 60 min hold time at 20 °C. Effective inactivation, ≥ 4 log 10 of inactivation of MuLV virus, was seen for each antibody in these experiments.   3.4 Quertinmont ( 8 ) demonstrated that DNA level, total protein concentration, and lipid content (exceeding 1000 µg/mL) in a 0.45 % (w/v) Triton X-100 detergent inactivation step using HCCF were not statistically significant to the detection of MuLV virus following 60 min of inactivation using both monoclonal antibodies and Fc fusion proteins. Additionally, three Design of Experiment (DOE) robustness studies were carried out for three separate molecules varying biological drug concentration, total protein concentration, temperature, and Triton X-100 concentration. These studies demonstrated effective viral inactivation when Triton X-100 concentration is ≥ 0.2 %, temperature is between 15 °C to 25 °C, and hold time is ≥ 60 min in HCCF.   3.5 Blumel and Tounekti ( 9 ) showed complete inactivation of MuLV across 4 mAbs [2 IgGs and 2 immunoglobulin M (IgMs)] for all time points (0, 5, 30, and 60 min) using 1.0 % Triton X-100 for a 60-min hold time. The average log reduction factor (LRF) for these 15 studies was ≥ 3.89 log 10 . Analyses of the study data showed the higher level of Triton X-100 (1 %) necessitated a large dilution to mitigate cytotoxicity of the MuLV indicator cells. No detectable virus was seen at any of the time points tested across these 15 studies and the claimed LRF was completely dependent on the starting viral titer of the MuLV feed stock in these studies.   3.6 The extent of this retroviral inactivation could be dependent on certain reaction parameters including clarification, Triton X-100 concentration, hold time, pH, and inactivation temperature. However, managing parameters that give robust and effective retrovirus inactivation as specified by this practice, in conjunction with other clearance unit operations, can assure effective retroviral inactivation.   3.7 This practice incorporates parameters that give effective retrovirus inactivation, which can be used as modular validation of the viral clearance process for the specified viruses. Scope  1.1 This practice assures effective inactivation of ≥ 4 log 10 of infectious rodent retrovirus (that is, reduction from 10 000 to 1 infectious rodent retrovirus or removal of 99.99 % of infectious rodent retroviruses) in the manufacturing processes of monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc fusion proteins manufactured in rodent-derived cell lines that do not target retroviral antigens. Rodent retrovirus is used as a model for rodent cell substrate endogenous retrovirus-like particles potentially present in the production stream of these proteins.   1.2 The parameters specified for this practice are clarification, Triton X-100 detergent concentration, hold time, pH, and inactivation temperature.   1.3 This practice can be used in conjunction with other clearance or inactivation unit operations that are orthogonal to this inactivation mechanism to achieve sufficient total process clearance or inactivation of rodent retrovirus.   1.4 This detergent inactivation step is performed on a clarified, cell-free intermediate of the monoclonal antibody or IgG Fc fusion protein.   1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

,E3324-22,Standard Test Method for Lipid Quantitation in Liposomal Formulations Using Ultra-High-Performance  Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) with Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry  (TQMS),"Significance and Use  5.1 Liposomes are vesicles of nanoscale dimensions, composed of lipid bilayers, which are used for various diagnostic and therapeutic applications ( 9 ) . The growing interest in liposomal formulations in the delivery of various drugs, antisense oligonucleotides, cloned genes, or recombinant proteins by the biopharmaceutical industry, warrants QC and thorough characterization of the constituent lipids. Lipid structure, composition, and concentration are key attributes in determining the quality and efficacy of a liposomal drug product as they influence the stability of liposomes, drug loading, release kinetics, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetic properties ( 9 ) . Cholesterol modulates the lipid membrane fluidity, elasticity, and permeability; hence, it plays a key role in controlled drug release and increased stability of the liposome ( 10 ) .   5.2 This test method provides a rapid and reliable protocol for the determination of cholesterol, DSPE-PEG 2000, and HSPC in liposomal formulations using UHPLC-TQMS. Assessment of the stability of the analytes in terms of their degradation profiles is not included in this test method ( 11 ) . This test method will benefit the biopharmaceutical industry in ascertaining quality assessment of liposomal formulations and monitoring batch-to-batch consistency for large-scale production, thereby facilitating safe and efficient drug development and regulatory review.   5.3 UHPLC-MS/MS measurements are analytically more sensitive and specific for lipid analysis compared to other contemporary techniques using universal detectors, such as a charged aerosol or an evaporative light-scattering detector. For liposomes, MS/MS has further advantages over ultraviolet detectors, as lipids lack chromophores for detection. In this test method, TQMS has been used as the MS/MS technique of choice because of its high selectivity, sensitivity, S/N, accuracy, and broad linear range of quantitation, thereby allowing reproducible quantitation of the analytes, especially at low concentrations.   5.4 According to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations [21 CFR 211.194(a)(2)], users are required to verify the suitability of the test method under actual conditions of use. Validation should assess the suitability of the test method for the product matrix, recovery of the analytes from the product matrix, suitability of chromatographic conditions and column, appropriateness of the detector signal response, specificity, limit of detection and quantitation, accuracy, and precision. The user may need to optimize method parameters and cross validate if a different chromatography column, ionization method, or mass analyzer is used. Scope  1.1 This test method describes the determination of lipid components in liposomal formulations, which includes sample solubilization in methanol followed by separation of the analytes using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and detection with tandem mass-spectrometry (MS/MS). This test method adheres to multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQMS).   1.2 This test method is specific for liposomal formulations containing cholesterol, 1,2- distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy (polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE- PEG 2000), and hydrogenated (soy) L-α-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC).   1.3 This test method is applicable to report the absolute concentrations of cholesterol, DSPE-PEG 2000, and HSPC and their ratio (DSPE-PEG 2000: HSPC: cholesterol) in liposomal formulations. Assessment of the stability of the analytes in terms of their degradation as a result of oxidation or hydrolysis is beyond the scope of this test method.   1.4 This test method includes calibration and standardization, sample preparation, UHPLC-TQMS instrumentation, potential interferences, method validation with acceptance criteria, sample analysis, and data reporting.   1.5 The detection limits for cholesterol, DSPE-PEG 2000, and HSPC using this test method are 5.3, 0.5, and 0.5 ng/g, respectively. In addition, the quantitation limits for cholesterol, DSPE-PEG 2000, and HSPC are 10.6, 0.8, and 0.5 ng/g, respectively.   1.6 This test method is intended for concentration ranges of 8-1600 ng/g for cholesterol, and of 2-400 ng/g for DSPE-PEG 2000 and HSPC.   1.7 All observed and calculated values shall conform to the guidelines for significant digits and rounding as established in Practice D6026 .   1.8  Units— The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. Where appropriate, c.g.s units in addition to SI units are included in this standard.   1.9  This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.   1.10  This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
