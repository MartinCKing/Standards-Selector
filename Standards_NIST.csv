NIST,NIST AI 100-2e2025,"Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations","This NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report provides a taxonomy of concepts and defines terminology in the field of adversarial machine learning (AML). The taxonomy is arranged in a conceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker goals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life cycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the consequences of those attacks. The terminology used in this report is consistent with the literature on AML and is complemented by a glossary of key terms associated with the security of AI systems. Taken together, the taxonomy and terminology are meant to inform other standards and future practice guides for assessing and managing the security of AI systems by establishing a common language for the rapidly developing AML landscape.",https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-2e2025.pdf,
NIST,FIPS 203,Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard,"""A key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is a set of algorithms that, under certain conditions, can be used by two parties to establish a shared secret key over a public channel. A shared secret key that is securely established using a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms to perform basic tasks in secure communications, such as encryption and authentication. This standard specifies a key-encapsulation mechanism called ML-KEM. The security of ML-KEM is related to the computational difficulty of the Module Learning with Errors problem. At present, ML-KEM is believed to be secure, even against adversaries who possess a quantum computer. This standard specifies three parameter sets for ML-KEM. In order of increasing security strength and decreasing performance, these are ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final,
NIST,FIPS 204,Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard,"""Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. This standard specifies ML-DSA, a set of algorithms that can be used to generate and verify digital signatures. ML-DSA is believed to be secure, even against adversaries in possession of a large-scale quantum computer.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final,
NIST,FIPS 205,Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard,"""This standard specifies the stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm (SLH-DSA). Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+, which was selected for standardization as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final,
