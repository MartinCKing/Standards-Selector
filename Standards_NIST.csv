NIST,FIPS 203,Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard,"""A key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is a set of algorithms that, under certain conditions, can be used by two parties to establish a shared secret key over a public channel. A shared secret key that is securely established using a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms to perform basic tasks in secure communications, such as encryption and authentication. This standard specifies a key-encapsulation mechanism called ML-KEM. The security of ML-KEM is related to the computational difficulty of the Module Learning with Errors problem. At present, ML-KEM is believed to be secure, even against adversaries who possess a quantum computer. This standard specifies three parameter sets for ML-KEM. In order of increasing security strength and decreasing performance, these are ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final,
NIST,FIPS 204,Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard,"""Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. This standard specifies ML-DSA, a set of algorithms that can be used to generate and verify digital signatures. ML-DSA is believed to be secure, even against adversaries in possession of a large-scale quantum computer.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final,
NIST,FIPS 205,Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard,"""This standard specifies the stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm (SLH-DSA). Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+, which was selected for standardization as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.""",https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final,
