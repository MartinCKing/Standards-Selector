ISO,ISO/TS 9241-430:2021,Ergonomics of human-system interaction  Part 430: Recommendations for the design of non-touch gestural input for the reduction of biomechanical stress,"This document provides guidance on the design, selection and optimization of non-contacting hand and arm gestures for human-computer interaction. It addresses the assessment of usability and fatigue associated with different gesture set designs and provides recommendations for approaches to evaluating the design and selection of gestures. This document also provides guidance on the documentation of the process for selecting gesture sets.
This document applies to gestures expressed by humans. It does not consider the technology for detecting gestures or the system response when interpreting a gesture. Non-contacting hand gestures can be used for input in a variety of settings, including the workplace or in public settings and when using fixed screens, mobile, virtual reality, augmented reality or mixed-mode reality devices.
Some limitations of this document are:
â€”Â Â Â  The scope is limited to non-contacting gestures and does not include other forms of inputs. For example, combining gesture with speech, gaze or head position can reduce input error, but these combinations are not considered here.
â€”Â Â Â  The scope is limited to non-contacting arm, hand and finger gestures, either unilateral (one-handed) or bilateral (two-handed).
â€”Â Â Â  The scope assumes that all technological constraints are surmountable. Therefore, there is no consideration of technological limitations with interpreting ultra-rapid gestures, gestures performed by people of different skin tones or wearing different colours or patterns of clothing.
â€”Â Â Â  The scope is limited to UI-based command-and-control human computer interaction (HCI) tasks and does not include gaming scenarios, although the traversal of in-game menus and navigation of UI elements is within scope.
â€”Â Â Â  The scope does not include HCI tasks for which an obviously more optimal input method exists. For example, speech input is superior for inputting text than gesture input.
â€”Â Â Â  The scope includes virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) and the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs).
â€”Â Â Â  The scope does not include the discoverability of gestures but does include the learnability and memorability of gestures. It is assumed that product documentation and tutorials will adequately educate end users about which gestures are possible. Therefore, assessing gesture discoverability is not a primary goal of the recommendations in this document.",https://www.iso.org/standard/80270.html

This document does not address the hardware issues of the transmission and the production of auditory information.
NOTE 1  Volume is dependent on hardware and thus cannot always be absolutely controlled by software. Environmental conditions can also affect the ability for sounds to be perceived, which can be beyond the ability of the software to take into account.
This document does not apply to auditory alarms, warnings or other safety-related uses of auditory information.
NOTE 2  Safety-related uses of auditory presentation of information are covered in various domain specific standards, such as ISO 7731:2003 which deals with auditory danger signals for public and work areas, and IEC 60601-1-8:2006 which provides very specific requirements for auditory alarms for medical devices.
While this document applies to the presentation of all non-safety-related information, it does not include application domain specific guidance (e.g., audio instructions for consumer products).
This document can be utilized throughout the design process (e.g. as specification and guidance for designers during design or as a basis for heuristic evaluation). Its provisions for the presentation of information depend on the auditory design approach, the task, the user, the environment and the single or multiple technologies that can be used for presenting the information. Consequently, this document cannot be applied without knowledge of the context of use. It is not intended to be used as a prescriptive set of rules to be applied in its entirety but rather assumes that the designer has proper information available concerning task and user requirements and understands the use of available technology.
This document does not address visual or tactile/haptic presentation of information or modality shifting for the presentation of auditory information in other modalities.

Information is provided on the determination of potentially relevant organo-arsenic species such as methylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) which may be encountered at very low levels in natural surface waters. 
The linear working dynamic range depends on the operating conditions and the method of detection used; under standard conditions, it typically ranges from 0,5 Âµg/l to 50 Âµg/l for each species. Samples containing arsenic at concentrations higher than the linear dynamic range can be analysed after suitable dilution.
This method is based on high performance liquid chromatography separation of arsenic species with either inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) as a method of detection.
The sensitivity of this method depends on the method of detection and the instrumental operating conditions selected. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method also depends on the operating conditions of the analytical system used and the extent of the calibration range used.

Such a pulse may be produced, e.g. by X-ray flash units or high-intensity femtosecond-lasers. Other specifications are not applicable for much shorter pulses; one example is the time-dependent behaviour of the air kerma rate. This may not be measurable for technical reasons as no suitable instrument is available, e.g. for pulses produced by a femtosecond-laser.

a)    time-dependent behaviour of the air kerma rate of the pulse;
b)    time-dependent behaviour of the X-ray tube high voltage during the pulse;
c)    uniformity of the air kerma rate within a cross-sectional area of the radiation beam;

This document is intended to inform users about the different technologies, including the characteristics, the maturity and the boundaries of these technologies.
This document is applicable to organizations involved in the cement industry and other stakeholders (e.g. policy makers).

ISO,ISO/TR 27921:2020,Carbon dioxide capture transportation and geological storage  Cross Cutting Issues  CO2 stream composition,"The primary aim of this document is to describe the main compositional characteristics of the CO2 stream downstream of the capture unit, taking into account common purification options. Accordingly, this document will characterize the different types of impurities and present examples of concentrations determined in recent capture pilot projects as well as through literature review. It identifies ranges of concentrations, giving priority to in situ measurements when available.
The second aim of this document is to identify potential impacts of impurities on all components of the CCS chain, from surface installations (including transport) to the storage complex. For example, impurities can have a significant effect on the phase behaviour of CO2 streams in relation to their concentration. Chemical effects also include the corrosion of metals. The composition of the CO2 stream can also influence the injectivity and the storage capacity, due to physical effects (such as density or viscosity changes) and geochemical reactions in the reservoir. In case of a leakage, toxic and ecotoxic effects of impurities contained in the leaking CO2 stream could also impact the environment surrounding the storage complex.
In order to ensure energy efficiency, proper operation of the whole CCS chain and not to affect its surrounding environment, operators usually limit the concentrations of some impurities, which can, in-turn, influence the design of the capture equipment and purification steps. Such limits are case specific and cannot be described in this report; however, some examples of CO2 stream specifications discussed in the literature are presented in Annex A.
The required purity of the CO2 stream delivered from the capture plant will to a large degree depend on the impurity levels that can be accepted and managed by the transport, injection and storage operations. The capture plant operators will therefore most probably need to purify the CO2 stream to comply with the required transport, injection, storage specifications or with legal requirements.
Monitoring of the CO2 stream composition plays an important role in the management of the entire CCS process. Methods of measuring the composition of the CO2 stream and in particular the concentrations of impurities are described and other parameters relevant for monitoring at the various steps of the CCS chain are described.
The interplay between the set CO2 stream specifications and the efficiency of the entire CCS process is also explained. Finally, the mixing of CO2 streams coming from different sources before transport or storage is addressed, and the main benefits, risks and operational constraints are presented.",https://www.iso.org/standard/67273.html
ISO,ISO/TR 27918:2018,Lifecycle risk management for integrated CCS projects,"ISO/TR 27918:2018 is designed to be an information resource for the potential future development of a standard for overall risk management for CCS projects. The risks associated with any one stage of the CCS process (capture, transportation, or storage) are assumed to be covered by specific standard(s) within ISO/TC 265 and other national and/or international standards. For example, the risks associated with CO2 transport by pipelines are covered in ISO 27913. The scope of this document is intended to address more broadly applicable lifecycle risk management issues for integrated CCS projects. Specifically, the focus of this document is on risks that affect the overarching CCS project or risks that cut across capture, transportation, and storage affecting multiple stages. It needs to be noted that environmental risks, and risks to health and safety should be very low for CCS projects provided the project is carefully designed and executed. Risk identification and management is part of the due diligence process.
A list of acronyms is included in Annex A.
Clause 5 includes an analysis of how a CCS standard could address aspects of risk analysis that apply to all elements of the CCS chain, such as:
-      risk identification (identifying the source of risk, event, and target of impact)[1];
-      risk evaluation and rating;
-      risk treatment;
-      risk management strategy and reporting.
Clause 6 comprises an inventory of the overarching and crosscutting risks. These include issues such as:
-      environmental impact assessment;
-      risk communication and public engagement;
-      integration risks between capture, storage, and transportation operators, such as risk of non-conformance of CO2 stream to required specifications;
-      integration risks associated with shared infrastructure (hubs of sources, common pipelines, hubs of storage sites);
-      risks resulting from interruption or intermittency of CO2 supply and/or CO2 in-take;
-      risks associated with policy uncertainty;
-      incidental risks from activities related to the capture, transportation or storage processes without being specifically covered in the respective standards (e.g. management or disposal of water produced as a by-product of CO2 storage).
Clause 7 describes implications and considerations for a potential standard on lifecycle risks for integrated CCS projects.

In ISO/TR 24679-6:2017, an overall structural analysis of a building is undertaken. It consists in a numerical assessment of the structural performance of an eight-storey concrete building when subjected to a fire. This analysis is performed in order to demonstrate that the fire safety objectives, for the relevant design fire scenarios, due to structural behaviour of building in the event of fire, are met with the trial plan for the safety of structure. With regards to this, a fully developed fire was studied.
The purpose of this document is to assess the performance of an office building which is fully accessible to public in case of fire, using ISO 24679â€‘1. In this respect, a critical design fire was identified and analysed using detailed fire modelling. A more detailed analysis was then performed for critical design fire using the finite element model. The advanced model provided all the comprehensive information necessary for analysing the given built environment with respect to fire safety.

In an attempt to facilitate the understanding of the design process presented herein, this document follows the same step-by-step procedure as that given in ISOÂ 24679-1.
The fire safety engineering approach is applied to a multi-storey timber building with respect to fire resistance and considers specific design fire scenarios, which impact the fire resistance of structural members.
A component-level (member analysis) approach to fire performance analysis is adopted in this worked example. Such an approach generally provides a more conservative design than a system-level (global structural) analysis or an analysis of parts of the structure where interaction between components can be assessed. An advantage of the component-level approach is that calculations can be done with the use of simple analytical models or spreadsheets. Advanced modelling using computational fluid dynamics is presented to replicate an actual office cubicle fire scenario and for assessing timber contribution to fire growth, intensity and duration, if any. The thermo-structural behaviour of the timber elements is assessed through advanced modelling using the finite element method.

This document describes the adopted process which follows the same step by step procedure as that provided in ISO 24679-1. The annexes of this document present the detailed assessment results obtained for the most severe fire scenarios on the basis of the outcome of this specific fire safety engineering procedure for the building.
The fire safety engineering applied in this example to the office building with respect to its fire resistance considers specific design fire scenarios as well as the corresponding fire development. It takes into account fully-developed compartment fires. In realistic situations, activation of fire suppression systems and/or intervention of fire brigade are expected, but their beneficial effects are not taken into account. It should be noted that these severe fire scenarios have been selected for fire resistance purposes.
Global structural behaviour is not explicitly considered, but implicitly included in the calculation formulae. Since the building of the example is located in a seismic region, principal structural elements are rigidly connected to each other. Load redistribution from heated elements to cold surrounding elements exists, but it's not taken into account in the design calculations. By this approach, design is conservative, while the process of safety checking is greatly simplified and clear. As a result, all the calculations were carried out by explicit algebraic formulae.",https://www.iso.org/standard/63023.html

The performance of this CAM does not only depend on the metrological aspect characterized by the decision threshold, the limit of detection and the measurement uncertainties but also on its dynamic capacity characterized by its response time as well as on the minimum detectable activity concentration corresponding to an acceptable false alarm rate.
The ideal performance is to have a minimum detectable activity concentration as low as possible associated with a very short response time, but unfortunately these two criteria are in opposition. It is therefore important that the CAM and the choice of the adjustment parameters and the alarm levels be in line with the radiation protection objectives.
This document describes

It is therefore important that the CAM and the choice of the adjustment parameters and the alarm levels be in line with the radiation protection objectives.
The knowledge of a few factors is needed to interpret the response of a CAM and to select the appropriate CAM type and its operating parameters.
Among those factors, it is important to know the half-lives of the radionuclides involved, in order to select the appropriate detection system and its associated model of evaluation.
CAM using filter media accumulation sampling techniques are usually of two types:
a)    fixed filter;
b)    moving filter.
This document first describes the theory of operation of each CAM type i.e.:
â€”     the different models of evaluation considering short or long radionuclides half-lives values,
â€”     the dynamic behaviour and the determination of the response time.
In most case, CAM is used when radionuclides with important radiotoxicities are involved (small value of ALI). Those radionuclides have usually long half-life values.
Then the determination of the characteristic limits (decision threshold, detection limit, limits of the coverage interval) of a CAM is described by the use of long half-life models of evaluation.
Finally, a possible way to determine the minimum detectable activity concentration and the alarms setup is pointed out.

ISO,ISO/TR 16982:2002,Ergonomics of human-system interaction  Usability methods supporting human-centred design,"ISO/TR 16982:2002 provides information on human-centred usability methods which can be used for design and evaluation. It details the advantages, disadvantages and other factors relevant to using each usability method.
It explains the implications of the stage of the life cycle and the individual project characteristics for the selection of usability methods and provides examples of usability methods in context.
The main users of ISO/TR 16982:2002 will be project managers. It therefore addresses technical human factors and ergonomics issues only to the extent necessary to allow managers to understand their relevance and importance in the design process as a whole.
Such issues are dealt with more fully in ISO 9241 which is complementary to ISO/TR 16982:2002 and is aimed at system developers, specifiers and purchasers of systems. Nonetheless, all parties involved in human-centred system development, including the end users of systems, should find the guidance in ISO/TR 16982:2002 relevant.
The guidance in ISO/TR 16982:2002 can be tailored for specific design situations by using the lists of issues characterizing the context of use of the product to be delivered. Selection of appropriate usability methods should also take account of the relevant life-cycle process.
ISO/TR 16982:2002 is restricted to methods that are widely used by usability specialists and project managers.
It does not specify the details of how to implement or carry out the usability methods described.

It is specific to models that are intended to predict the fire resistance or fire endurance of structural members or assemblies. Such models include models simulating the thermal behaviour and mechanical behaviour of fire-exposed load-bearing and/or separating structures and structural elements.
In ISO/TR 15656:2003, the term model includes all calculation procedures that are based on physical models. These mechanistic-based or physical models encompass all the physical, mathematical and numerical assumptions and approximations that are employed to describe the behaviour of structural members and assemblies when subjected to a fire.

The application and extension of results from calculation methods are generally limited to performance resulting from standard tests. Aspects of ISO/TR 15656:2003 are applicable to calculation procedures not based on physical models. Mechanistic-based models can often be used to calculate the behaviour of structures in non-standard fire exposures.

ISO/TR 12470-2:2017 is applicable to those non-loadbearing elements for which there is an ISO standard test procedure based upon the ISO 834 series for determining the fire resistance of a representative sample of the construction proposed for use in a specific building or just for general use. These elements are:
-      fire resisting door assemblies (excluding lift landing doorsets):

-     timber;
-     steel;

-      fire resisting vertical glazing ? metal framed:
NOTE       The rheology of glass is such that gravity has a disproportional influence on fire glass when it is heated to high temperatures and as a consequence, it is not possible to provide generic guidance on the extended application of horizontal glazed elements.

-     timber framed;

-      linear gap sealing;
-      service penetration sealing.
Fire resistance testing furnaces have fairly restricted size limitations and as a consequence, there is little confidence that the result obtained on an element of construction tested in accordance with the standard methods will behave in a similar manner when installed in the final building. 
Direct and extended applications of test results are the two possible ways to ensure that an element that is not identical to the tested construction will have an acceptable probability of obtaining the same fire rating as that of the original tested specimen. In both cases, these applications generally refer only to the fire rating that the building element can expect to reach if it, or a representative sample of it, were to be tested in a furnace according to the standard fire test conditions used in the reference test.
The criteria and methodology used in evaluating ductwork and dampers is significantly different from those used to evaluate conventional separating elements and for this reason, these forms of construction are not included in the scope of this document.

and smoke can be used in fire growth models for internal linings and other building products to describe the fire
hazard in a limited number of scenarios starting with fire development in a small room. Other scenarios include fire
spread in a large compartment and fire propagation down a corridor.

may be used for fire safety engineering purposes; and
b) generalized engineering calculations.
Sub-models can be included within the above models, provided the consistency of the whole is not prejudiced.

test program. It is also intended the test method addresses the influence the supporting construction has on
the performance of the seal system.
The methods described apply to the determination of data relating to single component penetration seals where
the penetration service does not melt out within the appropriate period of exposure to a fully developed fire.
The selection of the appropriate system depends upon many factors. Of particular importance is the size of the
penetration, since penetration seal systems are frequently penetration size (or size range) specific.
This is a guidance document, its purpose being to determine the critical parameters relating to the performance
of the seal being evaluated. Such parameters can then be used as a basis for interpolation and/or extrapolation
of the seal's performance. The procedures used have been developed utilizing small square penetrations,
single component penetration seals, and cylindrical conductors; however it is possible to generate a similar
series of tests using rectangular cross-section conductors if this is more appropriate to end use.
This part of ISO 10295 provides a structured approach designed to establish
â€” the mode of failure;
â€” the parameters critical to the performance of the penetration seal under test.
The mode of failure and critical parameters are ascertained using test configurations appropriate to the potential
performance of the product, in conjunction with clearly defined standard penetrations.
The results gained from the application of this technical report are designed to assist a suitably qualified person
to develop a direct and extended field of application for the penetration seal under test using in particular, the
principles and methodology given in ISO/TR 12470. Using the field(s) of application so generated, it should be
possible to classify the penetration seal, thus facilitating its incorporation into specifications.
The test configurations recommended in this part of ISO 10295 are not appropriate for evaluating multicomponent
penetration seals.
This part of ISO 10295 is not appropriate for characterizing all types of penetration seals, e.g. pipe closers/collars
and some gland systems, for which evaluation using ISO 10295-1 is more appropriate.
This part of ISO 10295 does not address the distance required between services that can generate their own
heat. When a live service is being evaluated, it is necessary to give consideration to the distance required
between penetrations.",https://www.iso.org/standard/50719.html

The method is based on the growth of target organisms in a liquid medium and calculation of the ""Most Probable Number"" (MPN) of organisms by reference to MPN tables. This method can be applied to all types of water, including those containing an appreciable amount of suspended matter and high background counts of heterotrophic bacteria. However it must not be used for the enumeration of coliform bacteria in marine water. When using for the enumeration of E. coli in marine waters, a 1â†’10 dilution in sterile water is typically  required, although the method has been shown to work well with some marine waters that have a lower than normal concentration of salts. In the absence of data to support the use of the method without dilution, a 1â†’10 dilution is used.
This method relies upon the detection of E. coli based upon expression of the enzyme bâ€‘Dâ€‘glucuronidase and consequently does not detect many of the enterohaemorhagic strains of E. coli, which do not typically express this enzyme. Additionally, there are a small number of other E. coli strains that do not express bâ€‘Dâ€‘glucuronidase.
The choice of tests used in the detection and confirmation of the coliform group of bacteria, including E. coli, can be regarded as part of a continuous sequence.

ISO,ISO 9241-125:2017,Ergonomics of human-system interaction  Part 125: Guidance on visual presentation of information,"ISO 9241-125:2017 provides guidance for the visual presentation of information controlled by software, irrespective of the device. It includes specific properties such as the syntactic or semantic aspects of information, e.g. coding techniques, and gives provisions for the organization of information taking account of human perception and memory capabilities. Those of its provisions that do not apply to specific types of visual interfaces clearly indicate any limitations to their applicability. It does not address specific details of charts, graphs or information visualization.
ISO 9241-125:2017 can be utilized throughout the design process (e.g. as specification and guidance for designers during design or as a basis for heuristic evaluation). Its provisions for the presentation of information depend upon the visual design approach, the task, the user, the environment and the single or multiple technologies that might be used for presenting the information. Consequently, this document cannot be applied without knowledge of the context of use. It is not intended to be used as a prescriptive set of rules to be applied in its entirety but rather assumes that the designer has proper information available concerning task and user requirements and understands the use of available technology.
Some of the provisions of this document are based on Latin-based language usage and might not apply, or might need to be modified, for use with languages that use other alphabets. In applying those that assume a specific language base (e.g. alphabetic ordering of coding information, items in a list), it is important that care is taken to follow its intent of the standard when translation is required to a different language.
ISO 9241-125:2017 does not address auditory or tactile/haptic presentation of information or modality shifting for the presentation of visual information in other modalities.

This method does not give a direct measure of the combustibility or rate of burning of a material or any definition of the safe upper limit of temperature for the plastics in use, and it is inappropriate to use it alone to describe or appraise the fire hazard or fire risk of materials, products or assemblies under actual fire conditions. However, results of this test are suitable for use as elements of a fire hazard or fire risk assessment which takes into account all of the factors pertinent to an assessment of the fire hazard of a particular end use.
Tests made under conditions of this method are potentially of considerable value in comparing the relative ignition characteristics of different materials.

ISO,ISO 8690:2024,Measurement of radioactivity  Gamma ray and beta emitting radionuclides  Test method to assess the ease of decontamination of surface materials,"This document applies to the testing of surfaces that may become contaminated by radioactive materials.
The ease of decontamination is a property of a surface and an important criterion for selecting surface materials used in the nuclear industry, interim storage or disposal facilities from which contamination can be removed easily and rapidly without damaging the surface. The test described in this document is a rapid laboratory-based method to compare the ease of decontamination of different surface materials.
The results from the test can be one parameter to take into account when selecting surface coatings such as varnish or impervious layers such as ceramics and other surfaces. The radionuclides used in this test are those commonly found in the nuclear industry (137Cs, 134Cs and 60Co) in aqueous form. The test can also be adopted for use with other radionuclides and other chemical forms, depending on the customer requirements, if the solutions are chemically stable and do not corrode the test specimen.
The test does not measure the ease of decontamination of the surface materials in practical use, as this depends on the radionuclide(s) present, their chemical form, the duration of exposure to the contaminant and the environmental conditions amongst other factors.
The test method is not intended to describe general decontamination procedures or to assess the efficiency of decontamination procedures (see ISOÂ 7503-1 to ISOÂ 7503-3).

It is applicable to beams subjected to three or four sided fire exposure.
For any cellular beam with a single web opening or where the web openings are considered to be of small diameter in relation to the web depth the applicability of this document is intended to be determined by a structural engineer
This document adopts the principle of establishing ratios of temperatures between and around openings in the web of a beam with the temperatures of a solid portion of that beam. This is with the intention that these data can be utilised within a structural model to derive the value and location of the associated limiting temperature of the beam at the fire limit state. The limiting temperature is then used in conjunction with data for the fire protection material determined from ISO 834-10 and ISO 834-11 to determine the necessary thickness of fire protection material for beams with web openings.
This document applies to fire protection materials that have already been tested and assessed in accordance with ISO 834-10 and ISO 834-11 and is not intended to be used in isolation. It covers fire protection systems that include both passive and reactive materials which follow the section profile as defined in this document.

This document contains an assessment method, which prescribes how the analysis of the test data should be made and gives guidance on the procedures that could be undertaken.
The assessment procedure can be used to establish:
a)    The thermal response of the fire protection system on cellular beams, (the thermal performance) on the basis of the temperature data derived from testing unloaded steel sections.
b)    The temperature ratio between the web post and the web reference temperature, which will vary depending on the web post width.

It is based on measurement of the absorption, the red DPD colour complex in a photometer or the colour intensity by visual comparison of the colour with a scale of standards that is regularly calibrated.
This method is appropriate for drinking water and other waters, where additional halogens like bromine, iodine and other oxidizing agents are present in almost negligible amounts. Seawater and waters containing bromides and iodides comprise a group for which special procedures are to be carried out.
This method is in practice applicable to concentrations, in terms of chlorine (Cl2), from, for example, 0,000 4 mmol/l to 0,07 mmol/l (e.g. 0,03 mg/l to 5 mg/l) total chlorine. For higher concentrations, the test portion is diluted.
Commonly, the method is applied as a field method with mobile photometers and commercially available ready-for-use reagents (liquid reagents, powders and tablets). It is essential that those reagents comply with minimum requirements and contain the essential reagents and a buffer system suitable to adjust the measurement solution to a pH range of typically 6,2 to 6,5. If there is doubt that water samples have uncommon pH values and/or buffer capacities, the user has to check and, if necessary, to adjust the sample pH to the required range. The pH of the sample is within the range of pH 4 and 8. Adjust, if necessary, with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid before the test.

Guidance for the development of in vitro test methods is included in an informative annex to ISO 7198:2016. It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
NOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.
It is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.
Vascular prostheses that are made of synthetic textile materials and synthetic non-textile materials are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
While vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.
Compound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
Endovascular prostheses implanted using catheter delivery and non-direct visualization are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It includes information on the development of appropriate test methods for graft materials, referenced in ISO 25539â€‘1 for materials used in the construction of endovascular prostheses (i.e. stent-grafts).
NOTE          Requirements for endovascular prostheses are specified in ISO 25539â€‘1.
The valve component of valved conduits constructed with a tubular vascular graft component, and the combination of the valved component and the tubular vascular graft component, are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It can be helpful in identifying the appropriate evaluation of the tubular vascular graft component of a valved conduit but specific requirements and testing are not described for these devices.
Cardiac and pericardial patches, vascular stents, accessory devices such as anastomotic devices, staplers, tunnelers and sutures, and pledgets are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.
NOTE          Requirements for vascular stents are specified in ISO 25539â€‘2.
Requirements regarding cell seeding are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. Tissue engineered vascular prostheses that contain or are manufactured using cells present many distinct manufacturing (e.g. aseptic processing, cell seeding, etc.) and testing issues than those produced with synthetic or non-viable biological materials. The in vitro testing requirements that are outlined in ISO 7198:2016 can be a useful guide for certain testing requirements for these cell-based products.
Pharmacological aspects of drug-eluting or drug-coated vascular prostheses are not addressed in ISO 7198:2016.
NOTE          Requirements for vascular device-drug combination products are specified in ISO 12417-1.

ISO,ISO 6385:2016,Ergonomics principles in the design of work systems,"ISO 6385:2016 establishes the fundamental principles of ergonomics as basic guidelines for the design of work systems and defines relevant basic terms. It describes an integrated approach to the design of work systems, where ergonomists will cooperate with others involved in the design, with attention to the human, the social and the technical requirements in a balanced manner during the design process.
Users of this International Standard will include executives, managers, workers (and their representatives, when appropriate) and professionals, such as ergonomists, project managers and designers who are involved in the design or redesign of work systems. Those who use this International Standard can find a general knowledge of ergonomics (human factors), engineering, design, quality and project management helpful.
The term ""work system"" in this International Standard is used to indicate a large variety of working situations, including permanent and flexible work places. The intention of this International Standard is to assist in the improvement, (re)design or change of work systems. Work systems involve combinations of workers and equipment, within a given space and environment, and the interactions between these components within a work organization. Work systems vary in complexity and characteristics, for example, the use of temporary work systems. Some examples of work systems in different areas are the following:
-      production, e.g. machine operator and machine, worker and assembly line;
-      transportation, e.g. driver and car or lorry, personnel in an airport;
-      support, e.g. maintenance technician with work equipment;
-      commercial, e.g. office worker with workstation, mobile worker with a tablet computer, cook in a restaurant kitchen;
-      other areas like health care, teaching and training.
The observance of ergonomic principles applies to all phases throughout the life cycle of the work system from conception through development, realization and implementation, utilization, maintenance and support to decommissioning.
The systems approach in this International Standard gives guidance to the users of this International Standard in existing and new situations.
The definitions and ergonomic principles specified in this International Standard apply to the design of optimal working conditions with regard to human well-being, safety and health, including the development of existing skills and the acquisition of new ones, while taking into account technological and economic effectiveness and efficiency.
The principles in this International Standard are applicable to many other human activities, e.g. in the design of products for domestic and leisure activities. A more general description of the principles in this International Standard can be found in ISO 26800.",https://www.iso.org/standard/63785.html

Additionally, this document describes the range of idealized values of seat-to-head transmissibility modulus and phase applicable to seated individuals without a back support subjected to zâ€‘axis sinusoidal or broad-band random vibration.
The ranges of idealized values defined in this document are considered to be valid for subjects on a rigid seat (or standing on a rigid platform for z-axis only), with feet supported and vibrated. The range of idealized seat-to-head transmissibility values is considered to be applicable also to the condition with the feet hanging freely. For seated individuals subjected to sinusoidal or broad-band random vibration, the apparent mass values are defined over the frequency range of 0,5 Hz to 10 Hz for the xâ€‘axis and yâ€‘axis, and over the frequency range of 0,5 Hz to 20 Hz for the zâ€‘axis. The frequency and amplitude characteristics of the vibration fall within the range for which most vibration exposure is likely to predominate while driving vehicles such as agricultural tractors, earth-moving machinery and fork-lift trucks. Application to automobiles is not covered by this document in view of the lack of a meaningful database for conditions involving posture and vibration excitation levels most likely associated with car driving.
The upper and lower values of modulus and phase defined at each frequency for each of the biodynamic response functions considered represent the range of most probable or idealized values. The middle values represent overall weighted means of the human data and define the target values for general applications. Such applications can involve the development of mechanical analogues for laboratory seat testing, or of functions to correct for the human interface when representing the body as a rigid mass, or the development of analytical human body models to be used for whole-body vibration exposure estimations or for seat and cushion design optimization.",https://www.iso.org/standard/73185.html

It is applicable to specimens that have an essentially flat surface and do not exceed 25 mm in thickness when placed in a horizontal orientation and subjected to specified levels of thermal irradiance in a closed cabinet with or without the application of a pilot flame. This method of test is applicable to all plastics.
It is intended that the values of optical density determined by this test be taken as specific to the specimen or assembly material in the form and thickness tested and are not to be considered inherent, fundamental properties.
The test is intended primarily for use in research and development and fire safety engineering in buildings, trains, ships, etc. and not as a basis for ratings for building codes or other purposes. No basis is provided for predicting the density of smoke that can be generated by the materials upon exposure to heat and flame under other (actual) exposure conditions.

(upward and downward) of flame over a specimen of a product orientated in the vertical position. A measure of
lateral spread can also be obtained. It provides data suitable for comparing the performance of materials,
composites or assemblies, which are used as the exposed surfaces of walls or other vertically orientated products
in construction applications. Some products with profiled surfaces can also be tested with a modified procedure
representative of the end-use conditions of the product.
1.2 Upward flame spread is not limited to surfaces which are vertical. It is recognized that an enhanced form of
upward, wind-aided flame spread can also occur on surfaces at an angle greater than 20Â° from the horizontal
without any external ventilation. This type of flame spread can occur in both planar sloping surfaces and stepped
surfaces such as stairs. Flame spread in these situations can become very rapid and can cause serious problems
in escape ways such as staircases. When assessing stepped or sloping surface materials, it may be more
appropriate to use a vertical flame spread test rather than a test in which the specimen is horizontal.
1.3 This part of ISO 5658 is applicable to the measurement and description of the properties of materials,
products, composites or assemblies in response to radiative heat in the presence of non-impinging pilot flames

as a wastepaper bin or an upholstered chair within an enclosure, and this scenario would generally be considered
to apply during the early developing stage of a fire (see ISO/TR 11696-1 and ISO/TR 11696-2). This part of

ISO,ISO 4869-2:2018,Acoustics  Hearing protectors  Part 2: Estimation of effective A-weighted sound pressure levels when hearing protectors are worn,"This document specifies three methods (the octave-band, HML and SNR methods) of estimating the A-weighted sound pressure levels effective when hearing protectors are worn. The methods are applicable to either the sound pressure level or the equivalent continuous sound pressure level of the noise. Although primarily intended for steady noise exposures, the methods are also applicable to noises containing impulsive components. It is possible that these methods could not be suitable for use with peak sound pressure level measurements.
The octave-band, H, M, L or SNR values are suitable for establishing sound attenuation criteria for selecting or comparing hearing protectors, and/or setting minimum acceptable sound attenuation requirements.",https://www.iso.org/standard/65582.html
ISO,ISO 4869-1:2018,Acoustics  Hearing protectors  Part 1: Subjective method for the measurement of sound attenuation,"This document specifies a subjective method for measuring sound attenuation of hearing protectors at the threshold of hearing. The method is a laboratory method designed to yield reproducible values under controlled measurement conditions. The values reflect the attenuating characteristics of the hearing protector only to the extent that users wear the device in the same manner as did the test subjects.
For a more representative indication of field performance the methods of ISO/TS 4869â€‘5 can be used.
This test method yields data which are collected at low sound pressure levels (close to the threshold of hearing) but which are also representative of the attenuation values of hearing protectors at higher sound pressure levels. An exception occurs in the case of amplitude-sensitive hearing protectors for sound pressure levels above the point at which their level-dependent characteristics become effective. At those sound pressure levels the method specified in this document is inapplicable, as it will usually underestimate sound attenuation for these devices.
NOTE       Due to masking from physiological noise in the occluded ear tests, sound attenuations below 500 Hz can be overestimated by a few decibels.",https://www.iso.org/standard/65581.html

ISO,ISO 4723:2023,Water quality  Actinium-227  Test method using alpha-spectrometry,"This document specifies a test method to determine the activity concentration of 227Ac in all types of waters by alpha spectrometry.
The test method is applicable to test samples of supply/drinking water, rainwater, surface and ground water, marine water, as well as cooling water, industrial water, domestic, and industrial wastewater after proper sampling and handling and test sample preparation (see ISO 5667-1, ISO 5667-3, ISO 5667-10). Filtration of the test sample is necessary.
The detection limit depends on the sample volume, the instrument used, the background count rate, the detection efficiency, the counting time, the chemical yield, and the progeny ingrowth. The method described in this document, using currently available alpha spectrometry apparatus, has a detection limit of approximately 0,03Â BqÂ·lâˆ’1, when directly measuring the alpha peak of 227Ac. This detection limit is lower than the WHO criteria for safe consumption of drinking water for any actinide alpha emitter (0,1Â BqÂ·lâˆ’1).[4] This value can be achieved with a counting time of 48Â h for a sample volume of 1Â l.
Only a small fraction of 227Ac decays through alpha emissions (~1,42Â %). An option to lower the detection limit of the method is to wait, let the progenies of 227Ac grow in, and measure an alpha progeny peak of 227Ac (e.g. 215Po). This is a longer technique, but a lower detection limit of approximately 0,000Â 2Â BqÂ·lâˆ’1 can be obtained by re-counting the sample approximately 90Â days after purification. The sample can be re-counted before 90Â days, but with a higher detection limit.
The test method(s) described in this document can be used during planned, existing and emergency exposure situations as well as for wastewaters and liquid effluents with specific modifications that can increase the overall uncertainty, detection limit and threshold. For an emergency situation, it is preferable to reduce the counting time rather than the sample volume.

The method is applicable to test samples of drinking water, rainwater, surface and ground water, after proper sampling and handling, and test sample preparation.
The detection limit depends on the sample volume, the instrument used, the background count rate, the detection efficiency, the counting time and the chemical yield. The detection limit of the method described in this document, using currently available equipment, is approximately 10Â mBqÂ·l-1, which is better than the WHO criteria for safe consumption of drinking water (1Â BqÂ·l-1).

ISO,ISO 29201:2012,Water quality  The variability of test results and the uncertainty of measurement of microbiological enumeration methods,"This International Standard gives guidelines for the evaluation of uncertainty in quantitative microbiological
analyses based on enumeration of microbial particles by culture. It covers all variants of colony count methods
and most probable number estimates.
Two approaches, the component (also known as bottomâ€‘up or stepâ€‘byâ€‘step) and a modified global (topâ€‘down)
approach are included.
The aim is to specify how values of intralaboratory operational variability and combined uncertainty for final
test results can be obtained.
The procedures are not applicable to methods other than enumeration methods.
NOTE 1 Most annexes are normative. However, only the annexes relevant to each case are to be applied. If the choice
is the global approach, then all normative annexes that belong to the component approach can be skipped and vice versa.
NOTE 2 Pre-analytical sampling variance at the source is outside the scope of this International Standard, but needs
to be addressed in sampling designs and monitoring programmes.
NOTE 3 The doubt or uncertainty of decisions based on the use of analytical results whose uncertainty has been
estimated is outside the scope of this International Standard.
NOTE 4 The extraâ€‘analytical variations observed in proficiency tests and intercalibration schemes are also not
detailed in this International Standard, but it is necessary to take them into consideration in analytical control. The use
of intercalibration data in uncertainty estimation offers the possibility for the bias between laboratories to be included

ISO,ISO 29200:2013,Soil quality  Assessment of genotoxic effects on higher plants  Vicia faba micronucleus test,"The purpose of ISO 29200:2013 is to describe a method for assessing genotoxic effects (chromosome breakage or dysfunction of the mitotic spindle) of soils or soil materials on the secondary roots of a higher plant: Vicia faba (broad bean). This method allows the assessment of genotoxicity (toxicity for genetic material) of soils and soil materials like compost, sludge, waste, fertilizing matters, etc. Two ways of exposure can be considered: a direct exposure of plants to the soil (or soil material) which is relevant for the real genotoxic potential and an exposure of plants to the water extract of the soil (or soil material). This last way of exposure to a leachate or an eluate allows the detection of the mutagens which are not adsorbed to soils and which may be transferred to aquatic compartments. Moreover, this test may be used to evaluate genotoxic effects of chemical substances and to waters, effluents, etc.",https://www.iso.org/standard/45340.html
ISO,ISO 2919:2012,Radiological protection  Sealed radioactive sources  General requirements and classification,"ISO 2919:2012 establishes a classification system for sealed radioactive sources that is based on test performance and specifies general requirements, performance tests, production tests, marking and certification. It provides a set of tests by which manufacturers of sealed radioactive sources can evaluate the safety of their products in use and users of such sources can select types which are suitable for the required application, especially where protection against the release of radioactive material, with consequent exposure to ionizing radiation, is concerned. ISO 2919:2012 can also serve as guidance to regulating authorities.
The tests fall into several groups, including, for example, exposure to abnormally high and low temperatures and a variety of mechanical tests. Each test can be applied in several degrees of severity. The criterion of pass or fail depends on leakage of the contents of the sealed radioactive source.
Although ISO 2919:2012 classifies sealed sources by a variety of tests, it does not imply that a sealed source will maintain its integrity if used continuously at the rated classification. For example, a sealed source tested for 1 h at 600 Â°C might, or might not, maintain its integrity if used continuously at 600 Â°C.
A list of the main typical applications of sealed radioactive sources, with a suggested test schedule for each application, is given in Table 3. The tests constitute minimum requirements corresponding to the applications in the broadest sense. Factors to be considered for applications in especially severe conditions are listed in 4.2.
ISO 2919:2012 makes no attempt to classify the design of sources, their method of construction or their calibration in terms of the radiation emitted. Radioactive materials inside a nuclear reactor, including sealed sources and fuel elements, are not covered by ISO 2919:2012.",https://www.iso.org/standard/54441.html

This includes conducting a site reconnaissance, establishing data quality objectives and designing sampling programmes. This document also provides a standardized method for reporting the results of the compilation and findings of the analyses, for use in contingency planning or for the assessment of the potential adverse environmental impact of a specific fire incident. This document does not include specific instruction on sampling and analysis of fire effluents. Sampling and analysis are the focus of a future document in the ISO 26367 series. 
ISO 26367-2:2017 is applicable to uncontrolled fires, including fires in commercial and domestic premises, unenclosed commercial sites, agricultural storage sites, wildland and forest fires, as well as fires involving road, rail and maritime transport systems.
ISO 26367-2:2017 focuses on the fire effluents that are environmentally significant, including pollutants causing short-term effects (e.g. pollutants causing biotope damage and components of smog) and long-term effects (e.g. persistent organic pollutants, POP). Since it is not possible to treat all potential pollutants that could be found in fire effluents in a single document, a list of those pollutants specifically addressed in this document is given below:
a)    pollutants with short-term effects: halogenated acids (HX), metals, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulates, and sulfur oxides (SOx);
b)    pollutants with long-term effects: metals, particulates, perfluorinated compounds (PFC), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and polyhalogenated dioxins and furans (PXDD/PXDF).

ISO,ISO 25597:2013,Stationary source emissions  Test method for determining PM25 and PM10 mass in stack gases using cyclone samplers and sample dilution,"ISO 25597:2013 specifies procedures for the extraction and measurement of filterable particulate matter from stationary source flue gas samples by: a) the use of cyclone samplers; b) the measurement of condensed particulate matter using dilution sampling technique, which simulates the interaction of stack gas components with the atmosphere as they mix after the stack exit.
ISO 25597:2013 provides for the use of two types of sampling train.
1)    Basic sampling train, a basic sampling train to measure filterable particles using sampling cyclones that can distinguish between particle sizes in the range of 2,5 Î¼m and 10 Î¼m. This method is especially suitable for measurements of particle mass concentrations above 50 mg/m3 as a half-hourly average at standard conditions (293 K, 1 013 hPa, dry gas) and applies to primary particulate matter (PM) emissions equal to or less than an aerodynamic diameter of nominally 10 Î¼m (PM10) from stacks or ducts.
2)    Dilution sampling train, a dilution sampling train that utilizes a dilution chamber that mixes flue gas with conditioned dilution air to simulate the interaction of the stack gas components with ambient air. This simulation process may lead to the condensation of particulate matter that might not otherwise be produced in the basic sampling train. The dilution sampling train uses in-stack sampling cyclones to measure filterable particles in the same manner as the basic sampling train, but in addition, utilizes additional PM2,5 and/or PM10 cyclones in the sampling train to measure particles formed in the dilution chamber.
This method is intended for the measurement of mass concentrations of particles smaller than 2,5 Î¼m aerodynamic diameter (PM2,5) using weighing techniques. The method can be used to measure mass concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 Î¼m aerodynamic diameter (PM10) or particles with aerodynamic diameters between 2,5 Î¼m and 10 Î¼m.
In this method, the dilution sampling train can be used in combination with the basic sampling train, using PM10 and/or PM2,5 depending upon the test objectives. The dilution sampling system is intended for applications where measurement is required of particles similar in characteristics to materials formed when a flue gas exhaust mixes with ambient air.
Particulate matter filter samples collected using dilution sampling can be further analysed to provide chemical composition data that are applicable for developing PM2,5 or PM10 emission inventories, visibility impact assessments, health risk assessments, and source?receptor studies related to PM2,5 and PM10 emissions.
This method is not applicable to the determination of ultrafine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 0,1 Î¼m. This method has been applied to emission sources with low moisture and saturated moisture stack gases; however, it is not applicable to effluents where entrained water droplets are present.
It is recognized that there are some combustion processes and situations that can limit the applicability of ISO 25597:2013. Where such conditions exist, caution and competent technical judgment are required, especially when dealing with any of the following: i) high-vacuum, high-pressure or high-temperature gas streams above 260 Â°C; ii)    fluctuations in velocity, temperature or concentration due to uncontrollable variation in the process; iii) gas stratification due to the non-mixing of gas streams.
There are also limitations specific to each sampling technique.
Stacks with entrained moisture droplets can have droplet sizes larger than the cut sizes for the cyclones. These water droplets normally contain particles and dissolved solids that become PM10 and PM2,5 following evaporation of the water.
For dilution sampling, a known limitation of this method concerns the presence of particles in the dilution air at very low concentrations, contributing to measurement background. This can be significant for certain very clean sources, e.g. gas-fired power plants. Dilution air system blanks are necessary when sampling sources with anticipated PM2,5 or PM10 mass concentrations less than or equal to about 1,0 mg/m3.",https://www.iso.org/standard/43029.html

ISO,ISO 24434:2024,Radiological protection  Radiological monitoring for emergency workers and population following nuclear/radiological incidents  General principles,"This document presents general principles for preparedness to conduct individual contamination screening, triage, monitoring and assessing radiation doses received by people exposed during and/or in the aftermath of a nuclear or major radiological incident. The document mainly focuses on the early response phase, which requires rapid actions to be undertaken for achieving the goals in support of, and according to, national or international guidelines on emergency response.
It addresses general requirements for
â€”Â Â Â Â  members of the public, this includes adults, vulnerable populations (such as children and pregnant women) and people with special needs (such as the elderly and disabled), and
â€”Â Â Â Â  emergency workers.
This document provides general procedures for screening, triage and monitoring these two categories of people. It deals with individual monitoring for potential external contamination, internal and external exposures and dose assessment. It also gives principles for organizing and managing a population screening centre and for registering and reporting the results of individual monitoring. This document is applicable to most exposure situations following a nuclear or major radiological incident affecting a large number of people, including:
â€”Â Â Â Â  significant release of radioactive materials (e.g. from a facility or nuclear power plant, during transportation);
â€”Â Â Â Â  radiological dispersal device (RDD);
â€”Â Â Â Â  improvised nuclear device (IND);
â€”Â Â Â Â  nuclear weapon.
Radiological incidents for which there is no release of radioactive material in the environment but only external exposures (e.g. linked to a Radiation Exposure Device (RED)) are outside the scope of this document[1]. However, some information given by this document may be of interest for this type of event.
The aim of the document is to ensure that the appropriate parties are prepared in advance. This document advises how to obtain and collect data quickly and accurately in order to inform decision makers. It does not specify the parties or individuals who are responsible for undertaking the actions.
This document is intended to give guidance to those in charge of monitoring and assessing doses received by populations in emergency exposure situations involving a large number of people potentially subject to internal/external contamination (and subsequent radiation doses). It can also serve as guidance to regulatory bodies.


[1]Â  Incidents resulting from RED exposure are excluded from consideration in this document because they do not result in contamination that would be detected by a portal monitor or handheld device. Identification of victims with only potential external exposure are determined by means such as evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, biodosimetry, EPR, etc.",https://www.iso.org/standard/78768.html
ISO,ISO 24426:2023,Radiological protection  Content of input data for the statistical analysis of dose records of individuals monitored for occupational exposure to ionizing radiation,"The objective of this document is to promote the harmonization of data and information reporting formats in order to provide the basis for the evaluation of occupational exposure with a view to allow for benchmarking capacity at the user level, technical review level, country level and global level (such as UNSCEAR) database or register on occupational exposure. Activity sectors and occupations (where employees are classified as occupationally exposed workers) that is included in this database or register as well as dose types and different values of interest concerning occupational exposure are described as follows.
A typical national dose register (NDR):
â€”Â Â Â Â  contains personal, employment, and dosimetric data of occupational employment and wage statistics (OEWs) in the country.
â€”Â Â Â Â  assists national authorities in controlling and safekeeping of the occupational doses and to allow statistical evaluations (e.g., dose trends to answer requests from regulators and others).
â€”Â Â Â Â  assists in regulatory control by notifying regulatory authorities of overexposures within their jurisdiction and the licensee in their respective facility.
â€”Â Â Â Â  contributes to health research and to the scientific knowledge on risks from occupational exposure to ionizing radiation.
â€”Â Â Â Â  provides dose histories to individual workers and organizations for work planning and for compensation and litigation cases.
All information provided by the NDR, including dose histories, may be subject to confidentiality requirements.
This document is aimed at national dose registries but may be also applicable to dosimetry services that provide data to national dose registries.
NOTEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Such a database or register on occupational radiation dose for different sectors will, among other reasons, allow to prepare the data necessary for more global surveys, such as those undertaken by the UNSCEAR and other databases such as IAEAâ€™s Information System on Occupational Exposure in Medicine, Industry and Research (ISEMIR), Information System on Occupational Exposure (ISOE) and the European Platform for Occupational Radiation Exposure (ESOREXâ€‘Platform). Presently, as the formats are different, the international description of national statistics is often incomplete or inaccurate, and in the end, the comparison of data is not established yet in many countries. This standard defines a common and easily shared format to collect reliable, traceable and directly comparable data on individual and collective exposure in activity sectors and occupations as defined in a common way.

ISO,ISO 23795-1:2022,Intelligent transport systems  Extracting trip data using nomadic and mobile devices for estimating C02 emissions  Part 1: Fuel consumption determination for fleet management,"This document specifies a method for the determination of fuel consumption and resulting CO2 emissions to enable fleet managers to reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a sustainable manner. The fuel consumption determination is achieved by extracting trip data and speed profiles from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver of a nomadic device (ND), by sending it via mobile communication to a database server and by calculating the deviation of the mechanical energy contributions of:
a) aerodynamics,
b) rolling friction,
c) acceleration/braking,
d) slope resistance, and
e) standstill,
relative to a given reference driving cycle in [%]. As the mechanical energy consumption of the reference cycle is known by measurement with a set of static vehicle configuration parameters, the methodology enables drivers, fleet managers or logistics service providers to calculate and analyse fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per trip by simply collecting trip data with a GNSS receiver included in an ND inside a moving vehicle. In addition to the on-trip and post-trip monitoring of energy consumption (fuel, CO2), the solution also provides information about eco-friendly driving behaviour and road conditions for better ex-ante and ex-post trip planning. Therefore, the solution also allows floating cars to evaluate the impact of specific traffic management actions taken by public authorities with the objective of achieving GHG reductions within a given road network.
The ND is not aware of the characteristics of the vehicle. The connection between dynamic data collected by the ND and the static vehicle configuration parameters is out of scope of this document. This connection is implementation-dependent for a software or application using the described methodology which includes static vehicle parameters and dynamic speed profiles per second from the ND.
Considerations of privacy and data protection of the data collected by a ND are not within the scope of this document, which only describes the methodology based on such data. However, software and application developers using the methodology need to carefully consider those issues. Nowadays, most countries and companies are required to be compliant with strict and transparent local regulations on privacy and to have the corresponding approval boards and certification regulations in force before bringing new products to the market.",https://www.iso.org/standard/76971.html

ISO,ISO 22675:2024,Prosthetics-Testing of ankle-foot devices and foot units-Requirements and test methods,"""This document primarily specifies a cyclic test procedure for ankle-foot devices and foot units of external lower limb prostheses, these differ in the potential to realistically simulate those loading conditions of the complete stance phase of walking from heel strike to toe-off which is relevant to the verification of performance requirements such as strength, durability and service life.

This potential is of particular importance for the assessment of the performance of a variety of recent designs of ankle-foot devices and foot units with specific characteristics that will only develop under realistic conditions of loading.

In addition, this document specifies a static test procedure for prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units, consisting of a static proof test and a static ultimate strength test, distinguished, besides other features (see NOTE), by the potential to generate heel and forefoot forces at lines of action conforming to those occurring at the instants of maximum heel and forefoot loading during the cyclic test.

These loading conditions are characterized by a loading profile determined by the resultant vector of the vertical and horizontal (A-P) ground reaction forces and by a locomotion profile determined by the tibia angle.

The test loading conditions specified in this document are characterized by standardized formats of these loading and locomotion profiles, applied by the cyclic and static test procedures to each sample of ankle-foot device or foot unit submitted for test.

This document specifies Test Ranges (R) by specifying locomotion profiles for the cyclic test in relation to the intended use. According to the concept of the tests of this document, each sample of ankle-foot device or foot unit submitted for test is, nevertheless, free to develop its individual performance under load.

This document is suitable for the assessment and testing of prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units with the strength requirements specified in 4.4 of ISO 22523:2006 (see NOTE). Prosthetic ankle-foot devices and foot units on the market, which have demonstrated their compliance with the strength requirements specified in 4.4 of ISO 22523:2006 through submission to the relevant tests of ISO 10328:2016, need not be retested to this document.

ISO,ISO 22030:2005,Soil quality  Biological methods  Chronic toxicity in higher plants,"ISO 22030:2005 describes a method for determining the inhibition of the growth and reproductive capability of higher plants by soils under controlled conditions. Two species are recommended: a rapid-cycling variant of turnip rape (Brassica rapa CrGC syn. Rbr) and oat (Avena sativa). The duration of test should be sufficient to include chronic endpoints that demonstrate the reproductive capability of the test plants.
By using natural test soils, e.g. from contaminated sites or remediated soils, and by comparing the development of the test plants in these soils with reference or standard control soils, the test is applicable to assess soil quality, especially the function of the soil as a habitat for plants.
This method can be modified to allow use of the chronic plant assay for the testing of chemicals incorporated into soil. By preparing a dilution series of a test substance in standard control soils, the same endpoints can be measured to assess the chronic toxicity of chemicals.

ISO,ISO 22017:2020,Water quality  Guidance for rapid radioactivity measurements in nuclear or radiological emergency situation,"This document provides guidelines for testing laboratories wanting to use rapid test methods on water samples that may be contaminated following a nuclear or radiological emergency incident. In an emergency situation, consideration should be given to:
â€”     taking into account the specific context for the tests to be performed, e.g. a potentially high level of contamination;
â€”     using or adjusting, when possible, radioactivity test methods implemented during routine situations to obtain a result rapidly or, for tests not performed routinely, applying specific rapid test methods previously validated by the laboratory, e.g. for 89Sr determination;
â€”     preparing the test laboratory to measure a large number of potentially contaminated samples.
The aim of this document is to ensure decision makers have reliable results needed to take actions quickly and minimize the radiation dose to the public.
Measurements are performed in order to minimize the risk to the public by checking the quality of water supplies. For emergency situations, test results are often compared to operational intervention levels.
NOTE    Operational intervention levels (OILs) are derived from IAEA Safety Standards[8] or national authorities[9].
A key element of rapid analysis can be the use of routine methods but with a reduced turnaround time. The goal of these rapid measurements is often to check for unusual radioactivity levels in the test sample, to identify the radionuclides present and their activity concentration levels and to establish compliance of the water with intervention levels[10][11][12]. It should be noted that in such circumstances, validation parameters evaluated for routine use (e.g. reproducibility, precision, etc.) may not be applicable to the modified rapid method. However, due to the circumstances arising after an emergency, the modified method may still be fit-for-purpose although uncertainties associated with the test results need to be evaluated and may increase from routine analyses.
The first steps of the analytical approach are usually screening methods based on gross alpha and gross beta test methods (adaptation of ISO 10704 and ISO 11704) and gamma spectrometry (adaptation of ISO 20042, ISO 10703 and ISO 19581). Then, if required[13], test method standards for specific radionuclides (see Clause 2) are adapted and applied (for example, 90Sr measurement according to ISO 13160) as proposed in Annex A.

ISO,ISO 21741:2020,Stationary source emissions  Sampling and determination of mercury compounds in flue gas using gold amalgamation trap,"This document describes a method for the sampling and measurement of mercury of both vapour and solid phases on stationary source flue gas streams. Mercury generally exists as elemental (Hg0) and oxidized (Hg2+) forms, both in the vapour and solid phases in flue gases. The vapour-phase (gaseous) mercury is captured either isokinetically or non-isokinetically with a gold amalgamation trap after removing solid-phase (particulate) mercury with a filter. Because gold amalgamation trap captures only gaseous elemental mercury, the oxidized mercury (Hg2+) in the vapour phase is converted to elemental mercury (Hg0) prior to the gold amalgamation trap. The concentration of gaseous mercury is determined using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) or atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) after releasing mercury by heating the gold amalgamation trap. Separately, particulate mercury is collected isokinetically on a filter and the concentration is determined using cold vapour AAS or cold vapour AFS after dissolving the particulate mercury into solution.
The total concentration of mercury in flue gas is expressed as the sum of both gaseous and particulate mercury concentrations.
The gold amalgamation method is intended for short-term (periodic) measurements of gaseous mercury ranging from 0,01 Î¼g/m3 to 100 Î¼g/m3 with sampling volumes from 0,005 m3 to 0,1 m3 and sample gas flow rate between 0,2 l/min to 1 l/min.

ISO,ISO 21286:2019,Soil quality  Identification of ecotoxicological test species by DNA barcoding,"This document specifies a protocol to identify ecotoxicological test specimens (mainly invertebrates and plants) to the species level, based on the DNA barcoding technique. This protocol can be used by laboratories performing DNA barcoding in order to standardize both the wet-lab and data analysis workflows as much as possible, and make them compliant with community standards and guidelines.
This document does not intend to specify one particular strain for each test method, but to accurately document the species/strain which was used.
NOTE 1    This does not imply that DNA barcoding is performed in parallel to each test run, but rather regularly (e.g. once a year, such as reference substance testing) and each time a new culture is started or new individuals are added to an ongoing culture.
This document does not aim at duplicating or replacing morphological-based species identifications. On the contrary, DNA barcoding is proposed as a complementary identification tool where morphology is inconclusive, or to diagnose cryptic species, in order to ensure that the results obtained from different ecotoxicological laboratories are referring to the same species or strain.
This document is applicable to identifications of immature forms which lack morphological diagnostic characters (eggs, larvae, juveniles), as well as the streamline identification of specimens collected in field monitoring studies, where large numbers of organisms from diverse taxa are classified.
NOTE 2    In principle, all species regularly used in ecotoxicological testing can be analysed by DNA barcoding. Besides the earthwoms Eisenia fetida and E. andrei, further examples for terrestrial species are Lumbricus terrestris, L. rubellus, Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea rosea, and A. caliginosa, Dendrodrilus rubidus, Enchytraeus albidus, and E. crypticus (Haplotaxida); Folsomia candida, F. fimetaria, Proisotoma minuta, and Sinella curviseta (Collembola); Hypoaspis aculeifer and Oppia nitens (Acari); Aleochara bilineata and Poecilus cupreus (Coleoptera); Scathophaga stercoraria, Musca autumnalis (Diptera) or Pardosa sp.

ISO,ISO 21285:2019,Soil quality  Inhibition of reproduction of the soil mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer) by soil contaminants,"This document specifies a chronic test method for evaluating the habitat function of soils and determining effects of soil contaminants and substances on the reproduction of Hypoaspis aculeifer by ? mainly ? alimentary uptake. This method is applicable to soils and soil materials of unknown quality, e.g. from contaminated sites, amended soils, soils after remediation, industrial, agricultural or other sites under concern and waste materials (e.g. dredged material, municipal sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, composed material, or manure, especially those for possible land disposal). The reproduction (= number of juveniles) is the measured parameter of the test. The test reflects the bioavailability of a mixture of contaminants in natural soils (contaminated site soils) to a species which represents a trophic level which is not covered by other ISO standards. This test is not intended to replace the earthworm (see ISO 11268-2) or Collembola (see ISO 11267) reproduction tests since this species belongs not only to a different trophic group but also a different taxonomic group (= mites; i.e. arachnids) than those used usually.
Effects of substances are assessed using a standard soil, preferably a defined artificial soil substrate. For contaminated soils, the effects are determined in the soil to be tested and in a control soil. Depending on the objective of the study, the control and dilution substrate (dilution series of contaminated soil) are either an uncontaminated soil comparable to the soil to be tested (reference soil) or a standard soil (e.g. artificial soil).
This document provides information on how to use this method for testing samples (soils or substances) under temperate conditions.
This document is not applicable to substances for which the air/soil partition coefficient is greater than one, or to substances with vapour pressure exceeding 300 Pa at 25 Â°C.

The toxicity can then be estimated based on these available concentrations.
The test described in this document aims to measure the release of inorganic and organic substances from soil and soil-like material as well as to produce eluates for subsequent ecotoxicological testing. For ecotoxicological testing, see ISOÂ 15799 and ISOÂ 17616.
The eluate obtained can subsequently be characterized by physical, chemical and ecotoxicological methods in accordance with existing standard methods. The test is not suitable for substances that are volatile under ambient conditions.
This procedure is not applicable to materials with a dry-matter-content ratio lower than 33Â %.
This test is mainly aimed at being used for routine and control purposes, and it cannot be used alone to describe all leaching properties of a soil. Additional leaching tests are needed for that extended goal. This document does not address issues related to health and safety.

ISO,ISO 21268-4:2019,Soil quality  Leaching procedures for subsequent chemical and ecotoxicological testing of soil and soil-like materials  Part 4: Influence of pH on leaching with initial acid/base addition,"This document specifies a test to obtain information on the short- and long-term leaching behaviour and characteristic properties of materials.
The document has been developed to measure the pH-dependent release of inorganic and organic substances from soil and soil-like material as well as to produce eluates for subsequent ecotoxicological testing. For ecotoxicological testing, see ISO 15799 and ISO 17616. The equilibrium condition, as defined in this document, is established by the addition of predetermined amounts of acid or base to reach desired final pH values.
NOTE 1  Volatile organic substances include the low molecular weight substances in mixtures such as mineral oil.
NOTE 2  It is not always possible to optimize test conditions simultaneously for inorganic and organic substances and optimum test conditions can also vary between different groups of organic substances. Test requirements for organic substances are generally more stringent than those for inorganic substances. The test conditions suitable for measuring the release of organic substances will generally also be applicable to inorganic substances.
NOTE 3  Within the category of organic substances, a significant difference in behaviour exists between the more polar, relatively water-soluble compounds and apolar, hydrophobic organic substances (HOCs). In the latter case, mechanisms of release (e.g. particle-bound or dissolved organic carbon-bound) can be more crucial as well as sorption losses of soluble HOCs on different materials with which they come in contact (e.g. bottles, filters). The test and the results should be used for leaching of organic substances only with thorough consideration of the specific properties of the substances in question and the associated potential problems.
NOTE 4  For ecotoxicological testing, eluates representing the release of both inorganic and organic substances are needed. In this document, ecotoxicological testing is meant to include genotoxicological testing.
The test method produces eluates, which can subsequently be characterized by physical, chemical and ecotoxicological methods in accordance with existing standard methods. The test is not suitable for substances that are volatile under ambient conditions.
For the purposes of ecotoxicological tests, the relevant pH range (see 8.2) will usually be pH 5 to pH 9.

The method is a once-through up-flow percolation test under standardized conditions of flow rate. The material is leached under dynamic hydraulic conditions. The document has been developed to measure the release of inorganic and organic substances from soil and soil-like material as well as to produce eluates for subsequent ecotoxicological testing. For ecotoxicological testing, see ISO 15799[6] and ISO 17616[7]. The test results enable the distinction between different release patterns, for instance wash-out and release under the influence of interaction with the matrix, when approaching local equilibrium between material and leachant.
This test method produces eluates, which can subsequently be characterized by physical, chemical and ecotoxicological methods in accordance with existing standard methods. The results of eluate analysis are presented as a function of the liquid/solid (L/S) ratio. The test is not suitable for substances that are volatile under ambient conditions.

NOTE 5    The test is generally not suitable for soils with hydraulic conductivities below 10âˆ’8 m/s (see also Annex B). It can be difficult to maintain the designated flow rate already in the range of saturated hydraulic conductivity between 10âˆ’7 m/s and 10âˆ’8 m/s.
The application of this test method alone is not sufficient for the determination of the leaching behaviour of a material under specified conditions different to those from the test procedure, since this generally requires the application of several test methods, behavioural modelling and model validation.

The results of measurements are used for preparing the maps of magnetic susceptibility of soils in the area of interest. From these maps, the areas of elevated and high magnetic susceptibility indicating high trace element total pollution load are discriminated for further identification of pollutants by geochemical methods.
This document is applicable to screening all TMPs-related anthropogenic emission sources including long-range transport of airborne elements, of which TMPs are carriers and indicators. Such emission sources comprise the majority of high-temperature industrial processes, where iron is present in any mineralogical form in raw materials, additives or fuels, is transformed into ferrimagnetic iron oxides (e.g. fossil solid and liquid fuels combustion, metallurgy, cement and ceramics industry, coke production, industrial waste landfills, land transport). This document is not applicable to screening anthropogenic emissions not associated with TMPs, e.g. organic pollutants or emissions from agricultural sources.
NOTE 1  Copper, zinc and other non-ferrous metal ores also contain iron (in many sulfides) as this element is abundant in almost all environments. During smelting, the iron occurring in sulfides is transformed into ferrimagnetic oxides (TMPs). However, in such cases, the proportion of TMPs and related PTEs is usually less than at coal combustion or iron metallurgy, for example, and not all PTEs are physically associated and transported by TMPs. Non-airborne elements are deposited in the close proximity of the emission source, while TMPs can be used in these cases as indicators of airborne elements and of the spatial distribution of the total element deposition from a smelter in the area.
In rare cases, some soils are developed on bedrock exhibiting geogenically high magnetism, which can cause false-positive results. This influence can, however, be easily indicated by measurements of magnetic susceptibility along soil profiles. This method is not applicable when the bedrock exhibits extremely high magnetic signals.

The concentrations obtained can be converted into activity concentrations of the different isotopes[9].
Due to its relatively short half-life and 238U isobaric interference, 238Pu can hardly be measured by this method. To quantify this isotope, other techniques can be used (ICP-MS with collision-reaction cell, ICP-MS/MS with collision-reaction cell or chemical separation). Alpha spectrometry measurement, as described in ISO 13167[10], is currently used[11].
This method is applicable to all types of water having a saline load less than 1 gÂ·lâˆ’1. A dilution of the sample is possible to obtain a solution having a saline load and activity concentrations compatible with the preparation and the measurement assembly.
A filtration at 0,45 Î¼m is needed for determination of dissolved nuclides. Acidification and chemical separation of the sample are always needed.
The limit of quantification depends on the chemical separation and the performance of the measurement device.
This method covers the measurement of those isotopes in water in activity concentrations between around[12][13]:
â€”          1 mBqÂ·lâˆ’1 to 5 BqÂ·lâˆ’1 for 239Pu, 240Pu and 237Np;

ISO,ISO 20414:2020,Fire safety engineering  Verification and validation protocol for building fire evacuation models,"This document describes a protocol for the verification and validation of building fire evacuation models. This document mostly addresses evacuation model components as they are in microscopic (agent-based) models. Nevertheless, it can be adopted (entirely or partially) for macroscopic models if the model is able to represent the components under consideration.
The area of application of the evacuation models discussed in this document includes performance-based design of buildings and the review of the effectiveness of evacuation planning and procedures. The evacuation process is represented with evacuation models in which people's movement and their interaction with the environment make use of human behaviour in fire theories and empirical observations[5]. The simulation of evacuation is represented using mathematical models and/or agentâ€‘toâ€‘agent and agent-to-environment rules.
The area of application of this document relates to buildings. This document is not intended to cover aspects of transportation systems in motion (e.g. trains, ships) since specific ad-hoc additional tests may be required for addressing the simulation of human behaviour during evacuation in these types of systems[6].
This document includes a list of components for verification and validation testing as well as a methodology for the analysis and assessment of accuracy associated with evacuation models. The procedure for the analysis of acceptance criteria is also included.
A comprehensive list of components for testing is presented in this document, since the scope of the testing has not been artificially restricted to a set of straightforward applications. Nevertheless, the application of evacuation models as a design tool can be affected by the numbers of variables affecting human behaviour under consideration. A high number of influences can hamper the acceptance of the results obtained given the level of complexity associated with the results. Simpler calculation methods, such as macroscopic models, capacity analyses or flow calculations, are affected to a lower extent by the need to aim at high fidelity modelling. In contrast, more sophisticated calculation methods (i.e. agent-based models) rely more on the ability to demonstrate that the simulation is able to represent different emergent behaviours. For this reason, the components for testing are divided into different categories, enabling the evacuation model tester to test an evacuation model both in relation to the degree of sophistication embedded in the model as well as the specific scope of the model application.
In Annex A, a reporting template is provided to provide guidance to users regarding a format for presenting test results and exemplary application of verification and validation tests are presented in Annex B.",https://www.iso.org/standard/78348.html

â€”          routine surveillance of radioactivity released from nuclear installations or from sites discharging enhanced levels of naturally occurring radioactive materials;
â€”          contributing to determining the evolution of radioactivity in the environment;
â€”          investigating accident and incident situations, in order to plan remedial actions and monitor their effectiveness;
â€”          assessment of potentially contaminated waste materials from nuclear decommissioning activities;
â€”          surveillance of radioactive contamination in media such as soils, foodstuffs, potable water, groundwaters, seawater or sewage sludge;
â€”          measurements for estimating the intake (inhalation, ingestion or injection) of activity of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in the body.
It is assumed that the user of this document has been given information on the composition of the test sample or the site. In some cases, the radionuclides for analysis have also been specified if characteristic limits are needed. It is also assumed that the test sample has been homogenised and is representative of the material under test.
General guidance is included for preparing the samples for measurement. However, some types of sample are to be prepared following the requirements of specific standards referred to in this document. The generic recommendations can also be useful for the measurement of gamma-ray emitters in situ.
This document includes generic advice on equipment selection (see Annex A), detectors (more detailed information is included in Annex D), and commissioning of instrumentation and method validation. Annex F summarises the influence of different measurement parameters on results for a typical gamma-ray spectrometry system. Quality control and routine maintenance are also covered, but electrical testing of the detector and pulse processing electronics is excluded.

ISO,ISO 1996-1:2016,Acoustics  Description measurement and assessment of environmental noise  Part 1: Basic quantities and assessment  procedures,"ISO 1996-1:2016 defines the basic quantities to be used for the description of noise in community environments and describes basic assessment procedures. It also specifies methods to assess environmental noise and gives guidance on predicting the potential annoyance response of a community to long-term exposure from various types of environmental noises. The sound sources can be separate or in various combinations. Application of the method to predict annoyance response is limited to areas where people reside and to related long-term land uses.
Community response to noise can vary differently among sound sources that are observed to have the same acoustic levels. This part of ISO 1996 describes adjustments for sounds that have different characteristics. The term ""rating level"" is used to describe physical sound predictions or measurements to which one or more adjustments have been added. On the basis of these rating levels, the long-term community response can be estimated.
The sounds are assessed either singly or in combination, allowing for consideration, when deemed necessary by responsible authorities, of the special characteristics of their impulsiveness, tonality, and low-frequency content, and for the different characteristics of road-traffic noise, other forms of transportation noise (such as aircraft noise), and industrial noise.
ISO 1996-1:2016 does not specify limits for environmental noise.
NOTE 1       In acoustics, several different physical measures describing sound can have their level expressed in decibels (e.g. sound pressure, maximum sound pressure, and equivalent continuous sound pressure). The levels corresponding to these physical measures normally will differ for the same sound. This often leads to confusion. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the underlying physical quantity (e.g. sound pressure level, maximum sound pressure level, and equivalent continuous sound pressure level).
NOTE 2       In this part of ISO 1996, quantities are expressed as levels in decibels. However, some countries validly express the underlying physical quantity, such as maximum sound pressure, in pascal or sound exposure in pascal-squared seconds.

ISO,ISO 19289:2015,Air quality  Meteorology  Siting classifications for surface observing stations on land,"ISO 19289:2015 indicates exposure rules for various sensors, but what should be done when these conditions are not fulfilled? There are sites that do not respect the recommended exposure rules. Consequently, a classification has been established to help determine the given site's representativeness on a small scale (impact of the surrounding environment). 
The classification process helps the actors and managers of a network to better take into consideration the exposure rules and thus it often improves the siting. At least, the siting environment is known and documented in the metadata. It is obviously possible and recommended to fully document the site but the risk is that a fully documented site might increase the complexity of the metadata, which would often restrict their operational use. That is why this siting classification is defined to condense the information and facilitate the operational use of this metadata information.
A site as a whole has no single classification number. Each parameter being measured at a site has its own class and is sometimes different from the others. If a global classification of a site is required, the maximum value of the parameters' classes can be used. 
In ISO 19289:2015, the classification is (occasionally) completed with an estimated uncertainty due to siting, which has to be added in the uncertainty budget of the measurement. This estimation is coming from bibliographic studies and/or some comparative tests.

ISO,ISO 19204:2017,Soil quality  Procedure for site-specific ecological risk assessment of soil contamination (soil quality TRIAD approach),"ISO 19204:2017 describes in a general way the application of the soil quality TRIAD approach for the site-specific ecological risk assessment of contaminated soils. In detail, it presents in a transparent way three lines of evidence (chemistry, ecotoxicology and ecology) which together allow an efficient, ecologically robust but also practical risk assessment of contaminated soils. This procedure can also be applicable to other stress factors, such as acidification, soil compaction, salinization, loss of soil organic substance, and erosion. However, so far, no experience has been gained with these other applications. Therefore, this document focuses on soils contaminated by chemicals.
NOTE 1       This document focuses on ecological risk assessment. Thus, it does not cover human health end points.
In view of the nature of this document, the investigation procedure is described on a general level. It does not contain details of technical procedures for the actual assessment. However, this document includes references relating to technical standards (e.g. ISO 15799, ISO 17616) which are useful for the actual performance of the three lines of evidence.
In ecological risk assessment, the effects of soil contamination on the ecosystem are related to the intended land use and the requirements that this use sets for properly functioning soil. This document describes the basic steps relating to a coherent tool for a site-specific risk assessment with opportunities to work out site-specific details.
ISO 19204:2017 can also be used for the evaluation of clean-up operations, remediation processes or management measures (i.e. for the evaluation of the environmental quality after having performed such actions).
NOTE 2       This document starts when it has already been decided that an ecological risk assessment at a given site needs to be performed. In other words, the practical performance of the soil quality TRIAD and the evaluation of the individual test results will be described. Thus, nothing will be said about decisions whether (and if yes, how) the results of the assessment are included in soil management measures or not.
NOTE 3       The TRIAD approach can be used for different parts of the environment, but this document focuses mostly on the soil compartment. Comparable documents for other environmental compartments are intended to be prepared in addition (e.g. the terrestrial aboveground compartment) in order to perform a complete site assessment, based on the same principles and processes.",https://www.iso.org/standard/63989.html

It applies, essentially, to systematic inspections based on comparative measurements or to preliminary site studies to guide the testing staff both in the choice of soil samples for measurement as a priority and in the specific analysis methods for implementation.
The gross Î± or Î² radioactivity is generally different from the sum of the effective radioactivities of the radionuclides present since, by convention, the same alpha counting efficiency is assigned for all the alpha emissions and the same beta counting efficiency is assigned for all the beta emissions.
Soil includes rock from bedrock and ore as well as construction materials and products, potery, etc. using naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) or those from technological processes involving Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM), e.g. the mining and processing of mineral sands or phosphate fertilizer production and use.

Different chemical separation methods are presented to produce strontium and yttrium sources, the activity of which is determined using proportional counters (PC) or liquid scintillation counters (LSC). 90Sr can be obtained from the test samples when the equilibrium between 90Sr and 90Y is reached or through direct 90Y measurement. The selection of the measuring method depends on the origin of the contamination, the characteristics of the soil to be analysed, the required accuracy of measurement and the resources of the available laboratories.
These methods are used for soil monitoring following discharges, whether past or present, accidental or routine, liquid or gaseous. It also covers the monitoring of contamination caused by global nuclear fallout.
In case of recent fallout immediately following a nuclear accident, the contribution of 89Sr to the total amount of strontium activity will not be negligible. This standard provides the measurement method to determine the activity of 90Sr in presence of 89Sr.
The test methods described in this document can also be used to measure the radionuclides in sludge, sediment, construction material and products by following proper sampling procedure.
Using samples sizes of 20 g and counting times of 1 000 min, detection limits of (0,1 to 0,5) BqÂ·kg-1 can be achievable for 90Sr using conventional and commercially available proportional counter or liquid scintillation counter when the presence of 89Sr can be neglected. If 89Sr is present in the test sample, detection limits of (1 to 2) BqÂ·kg-1 can be obtained for both 90Sr and 89Sr using the same sample size, counting time and proportional counter or liquid scintillation counter as in the previous situation.",https://www.iso.org/standard/69074.html

The limit of detection depends on the determinants, the equipment used, the quality of chemicals used for the extraction of the sample and the clean-up of the extract.
Under the conditions specified in this document, lower limit of application from 1Â Î¼g/kg (expressed as dry matter) for soils, sludge and biowaste to 10Â Î¼g/kg (expressed as dry matter) for solid waste can be achieved. For some specific samples the limit of 10Â Î¼g/kg cannot be reached.
Sludge, waste and treated biowaste may differ in properties, as well as in the expected contamination levels of PCB and presence of interfering substances. These differences make it impossible to describe one general procedure. This document contains decision tables based on the properties of the sample and the extraction and clean-up procedure to be used.

ISO 17892-9:2018 is applicable to the laboratory determination of triaxial shear strength under compression loading within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
The cylindrical specimen, which can comprise undisturbed, re-compacted, remoulded or reconstituted soil, is subjected to an isotropic or an anisotropic stress under drained conditions and thereafter is sheared under undrained or drained conditions. The test allows the determination of shear strength, stress-strain relationships and effective stress paths. All stresses and strains are denoted as positive numerical values in compression.
NOTE 1    This document provides a test for a single specimen. A set of at least three relatable tests are required to determine the shear strength parameters from these tests.

ISO 17892-8:2018 is applicable to the laboratory determination of undrained triaxial shear strength under compression loading within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
The cylindrical specimen, which can comprise undisturbed, re-compacted, remoulded or reconstituted soil, is subjected to an isotropic stress under undrained conditions and thereafter is sheared under undrained conditions.

ISO 17892-7:2017 is applicable to the determination of the unconfined compressive strength for a homogeneous specimen of undisturbed, re-compacted, remoulded or reconstituted soil under compression loading within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
This test method is useful to estimate the undrained shear strength of soil. It is noted that drainage is not prevented during this test. The estimated value for undrained shear strength is, therefore, only valid for soils of low permeability, which behave sufficiently undrained during the test.
NOTE       This document fulfils the requirements of unconfined compression tests for geotechnical investigation and testing in accordance with EN 1997â€‘1 and EN 1997â€‘2.",https://www.iso.org/standard/70789.html
ISO,ISO 17892-6:2017,Geotechnical investigation and testing  Laboratory testing of soil  Part 6: Fall cone test,"ISO 17892-6:2017 specifies a method of undrained strength index testing of both undisturbed and remoulded specimens of fine grained soils by the fall cone method.
ISO 17892-6:2017 is applicable to the laboratory estimation of undrained shear strength of a soil test specimen within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
In the fall cone test, a cone is allowed to fall with its tip towards a soil specimen, and the resulting penetration of the cone into the soil is measured. The penetration values are used to estimate the undrained shear strength. The fall cone test produces a complex shear in the test specimen, and does not represent either a vertical triaxial compression or a horizontal shear test. However, this index test may be correlated to some estimate of undrained shear strength determined in the laboratory by other test methods.
As the test is performed on a small laboratory specimen, the result may not agree with laboratory tests on larger specimens. In addition, the test specimen may not be fully representative of the soil in its natural state in the field; for example, the test specimen may not have fissures present in situ at a larger spacing than the specimen size.
Therefore, for the above reasons, the test can be regarded as an estimation of undrained shear strength, rather than a true measurement of it.
The ratio of the remoulded shear strength to the undisturbed shear strength may be used to estimate the sensitivity of a soil specimen. Time-dependent measurement of the shear strength may be used to assess the thixotropic regain of strength of a remoulded soil specimen.

ISO 17892-5:2017 is applicable to the laboratory determination of the compression and deformation characteristics of soil within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
The oedometer test is carried out on a cylindrical test specimen that is confined laterally by a rigid ring. The specimen is subjected to discrete increments of vertical axial loading or unloading and is allowed to drain axially from the top and bottom surfaces. Tests may be carried out on undisturbed, remoulded, recompacted or reconstituted specimens.
The stress paths and drainage conditions in foundations are generally three dimensional and differences can occur in the calculated values of both the magnitude and the rate of settlement.
The small size of the specimen generally does not adequately represent the fabric features present in natural soils.
Analysis of consolidation tests is generally based on the assumption that the soil is saturated. In case of unsaturated soils, some of the derived parameters may not be appropriate

ISO 17892-4.2016 is applicable to the laboratory determination of the particle size distribution of a soil test specimen by sieving, or sedimentation, or a combination of both within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
The particle size distribution is one of the most important physical characteristics of soil. Classification of soils is mainly based on the particle size distribution. Many geotechnical and geohydrological properties of soil are related to the particle size distribution.
The particle size distribution provides a description of soil based on a subdivision in discrete classes of particle sizes. The size of each class can be determined by sieving and/or sedimentation. Coarse soils are usually tested by sieving, but fine and mixed soils are usually tested by a combination of sieving and sedimentation, depending on the composition of the soil.
The sieving method described is applicable to all non-cemented soils with particle sizes less than 125 mm. Two sedimentation methods are described: the hydrometer method and the pipette method.

ISO 17892-3:2015 is applicable to the laboratory determination of the particle density of soil within the scope of geotechnical investigations, and describes two methods, a pycnometer method by fluid displacement and a pycnometer method by gas displacement.
The fluid pycnometer method described in this part of ISO 17892 applies to soil types with particle sizes under about 4 mm, or soils crushed to meet this requirement. Larger pycnometers are used for coarser materials. The particle size of soils suitable for testing in the gas pycnometer is limited by the dimensions of the specimen container of the particular gas pycnometer being used.

ISO 17892-2:2014 is applicable to the laboratory determination of the bulk density of soil within the scope of geotechnical investigations.
The linear measurement method is suitable for the determination of the bulk density of a specimen of soil of regular shape, including specimens prepared for other tests. The specimens used are either rectangular prisms or cylinders with circular cross sections.
The immersion in fluid method covers the determination of the bulk density of a specimen of natural or compacted soil by measuring its mass in air and its apparent mass when suspended in fluid. The method may be used when lumps of material of suitable size can be obtained.
The fluid displacement method covers the determination of the bulk density of a specimen of soil by measuring its mass in air and the mass of fluid displaced by immersion. The method may be used when lumps of material of suitable size can be obtained.
If the immersion in fluid method or fluid displacement method is used, and if the fluid is likely to penetrate into the specimen (eg water) the specimen should be coated before testing to prevent fluid penetration.
The bulk density of a soil is useful in the determination of the in situ overburden stress as a function of depth.
If required, the dry density of a specimen may be calculated from the bulk density and the water content, if known.",https://www.iso.org/standard/55244.html

ISO,ISO 17736:2010,Workplace air quality  Determination of isocyanate in air using a double-filter sampling device and analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography,"ISO 17736:2010 gives general guidelines for the sampling and analysis of airborne isocyanates in workplace air. ISO 17736:2010 is appropriate for organic compounds containing free isocyanate functional groups and is specific for the quantification of monomers, polymers and prepolymers, vapours and aerosols. Differential air sampling is performed with a segregating device which can show the physical state of the isocyanates analysed as found in the field. This capacity, however, may show limitations for given situations, e.g. when aerosols collected on the first filter contain free monomer that migrates to the second filter and is then quantified as vapour phase isocyanate. The determination of aromatic monomers includes toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 4,4'-diisocyanato-diphenylmethane (MDI). Aliphatic monomers include isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 4,4'-methylene bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI) and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). Isocyanate oligomers and prepolymers can also be determined using this method.
The double-filter method is designed to determine short-term (15 min) exposure concentrations of organic isocyanates in a workplace environment by personal monitoring or by fixed location monitoring. However, if the exposure is expected to be in vapour form only, then sampling time can be extended to 8 h. Since the filter is derivatized in the field immediately after sampling, loss of isocyanate aerosol because of its reaction with other chemicals is negligible except for very fast-reacting isocyanate systems such as foam spraying of MDI in polyurethane applications. The method is suitable for the measurement of airborne organic isocyanates in the NCO equivalent concentration range of 0,01 Âµg/sample to 2,1 Âµg/sample, corresponding to approximately 0,67 Âµg/m3 to 140 Âµg/m3 for a 15 l sample volume. This range brackets about eight times the current established threshold limit value (TLV) of 5 ppb for monomers set by many national authorities.",https://www.iso.org/standard/31517.html
ISO,ISO 17735:2019,Workplace atmospheres  Determination of total isocyanate groups in air using 1-(9-anthracenylmethyl)piperazine (MAP) reagent and liquid chromatography,"This document specifies a method for the sampling and analysis of airborne organic isocyanates in workplace air.
This document is applicable to a wide range of organic compounds containing isocyanate groups, including monofunctional isocyanates (e.g. phenyl isocyanate), diisocyanate monomers [e.g. 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 4,4â€²-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI)], prepolymers (e.g. the biuret and isocyanurate of HDI), as well as chromatographable intermediate products formed during production or thermal breakdown of polyurethane.
In mixed systems of HDI and IPDI products, it is impossible to identify and quantify low levels of IPDI monomer using this document, due to coelution of IPDI monomer with HDI-uretidinedione.
It is known that the method underestimates the oligomer in MDI-based products. Total isocyanate group (NCO) is underestimated in MDI-based products by about 35 % as compared to dibutylamine titration.
The method has been successfully modified to be used with LC-MS-MS for TDI monomer using an isocratic 70 % acetonitrile/30 % 10 mM ammonium formate mobile phase.
The useful range of the method, expressed in moles of isocyanate group per species per sample, is approximately 1 Ã— 10âˆ’10 to 2 Ã— 10âˆ’7. The instrumental detection limit for the monomers using both ultraviolet (UV) detection and fluorescence (FL) detection is about 2 ng monomer per sample. The useful limit of detection for the method using reagent impregnated filters is about 10 ng to 20 ng monomer per sample for both UV and FL detection. For a 15 l sample, this corresponds to 0,7 Âµg/mâˆ’3 to 1,4 Âµg/mâˆ’3. For impinger samples, which require solid phase extraction, experience has shown that the useful limit of detection is about 30 ng to 80 ng monomer per sample.",https://www.iso.org/standard/70406.html
ISO,ISO 17734-2:2013,Determination of organonitrogen compounds in air using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  Part 2: Amines and aminoisocyanates using dibutylamine and ethyl chloroformate derivatives,"ISO 17734-2:2013 gives general guidance for the sampling and analysis of airborne amines and aminoisocyanates in workplace air. It is strongly recommended that the determination of amines and aminoisocyanates is made together with the determination of isocyanates in air, using DBA as a reagent (see ISO 17734-1).
The method can be used for simultaneous determinations of amines, such as 4,4'-methylenediphenyldiamine (4,4'-MDA), 2,4- and 2,6-toluenediamine (2,4- and 2,6-TDA), and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (1,6-HDA), and compounds containing both isocyanate and amine groups, such as 4,4'-methylenediphenyl aminoisocyanate (4,4'-MAI), 2,4-, 4,2-, and 2,6-toluene aminoisocyanate (2,4-, 4,2-, and 2,6-TAI), and 1,6-hexamethylene aminoisocyanate (1,6-HAI). The method is suitable for collecting amines and aminoisocyanates in both the gas and particle phases. The instrumental detection limit for the amines is about 5 nmol/sample and for the aminoisocyanate, it is about 0,3 nmol/sample. For a 15 l air sample, this corresponds to 0,4 ngâ‹…m?3 for TDA and 0,03 ngâ‹…m?3 for TAI.",https://www.iso.org/standard/58007.html
ISO,ISO 17734-1:2013,Determination of organonitrogen compounds in air using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  Part 1: Isocyanates using dibutylamine derivatives,"ISO 17734-1:2013 gives general guidance for the sampling and analysis of airborne isocyanates in workplace air. When amines and aminoisocyanates are suspected to be emitted (e.g. from thermal degradation of PUR), it is recommended that, in addition to isocyanates, the amines and aminoisocyanates in the air are determined, using DBA and ethyl chloroformate as reagents (see ISO 17734-2).
The method is suitable for the determination of a wide range of different isocyanates in both the gas and particle phases. Typical monofunctional isocyanates that can be determined are isocyanic acid (ICA), methyl isocyanate (MIC), ethyl isocyanate (EIC), propyl isocyanate (PIC), butyl isocyanate (BIC), and phenyl isocyanate (PhI). Typical monomeric diisocyanates include 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), 1,5-naphthyl diisocyanate (NDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (HMDI). Multifunctional isocyanates that can be determined are typically oligomers in polymeric MDI, biuret-, isocyanurate-, and allophanate-adducts, and prepolymeric forms of isocyanates.
The instrumental detection limit for aliphatic isocyanates is about 5 nmol/sample and for aromatic isocyanates, it is about 0,2 nmol/sample. For a 15 l air sample, this corresponds to 0,6 ngâˆ™m?3 for HDI and 0,02 ngâˆ™m?3 for TDI.
The useful range, for a 5 l air sample, of the method is approximately 0,001 Âµgâˆ™m?3 to 200 mgâˆ™m?3 for TDI.",https://www.iso.org/standard/58006.html
ISO,ISO 17733:2015,Workplace air  Determination of mercury and inorganic mercury compounds  Method by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectrometry or atomic fluorescence spectrometry,"ISO 17733:2015 specifies a procedure for determination of the time-weighted average mass concentration of mercury vapour and inorganic mercury compounds in workplace air. Mercury vapour is collected on a solid sorbent using either a diffusive badge or a pumped sorbent tube. Particulate inorganic mercury compounds, if present, are collected on a quartz fibre filter. Samples are analysed using either cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) or cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) after acid dissolution of the mercury collected.
This International Standard is applicable to the assessment of personal exposure to mercury vapour and/or particulate inorganic mercury compounds in air for comparison with long-term or short-term exposure limits for mercury and inorganic mercury compounds and for static (area) sampling.
The lower limit of the working range of the procedure is the quantification limit. This is determined by the sampling and analysis methods selected by the user, but it is typically in the range 0,01 Âµg to 0,04 Âµg of mercury (see 13.1). The upper limit of the working range of the procedure is determined by the capacity of the diffusive badge, sorbent tube or filter used for sample collection, but it is at least 30 Âµg of mercury (see 13.2). The concentration range of mercury in air for which this International Standard is applicable is determined in part by the sampling method selected by the user, but it is also dependent on the air sample volume.
The diffusive badge method is not applicable to measurements of mercury vapour when chlorine is present in the atmosphere, e.g. in chloralkali works, but chlorine does not interfere with the pumped sorbent tube method (see 13.12.1). Gaseous organomercury compounds could cause a positive interference in the measurement of mercury vapour (see 13.12.2). Similarly, particulate organomercury compounds and gaseous organomercury compounds adsorbed onto airborne particles could cause a positive interference in the measurement of particulate inorganic mercury compounds (see 13.12.3).",https://www.iso.org/standard/67798.html

ISO,ISO 17289:2014,Water quality  Determination of dissolved oxygen  Optical sensor method,"ISO 17289:2014 specifies an optical method for the determination of dissolved oxygen in water using a sensor working on the basis of fluorescence quenching.
Measurement can be made either as a concentration of oxygen in milligrams per litre, percentage saturation (% dissolved oxygen), or both. Depending on the instrument used, detection limits of 0,1 mg/l or 0,2 mg/l can be reached according to the manufacturer's manual. Most instruments permit measurement of values higher than 100 %, i.e. supersaturation.
NOTE   Supersaturation is possible when the partial pressure of oxygen is higher than in air. Especially in case of strong algae growth, supersaturation up to 200 % and more is possible.
If waters with a saturation higher than 100 % are measured, it is essential to make arrangements to prevent the outgassing of oxygen during the handling and measurement of the sample. Similarly, it is important that the transport of oxygen into the sample is prevented if the saturation is below 100 %.
The method is suitable for measurements made in the field and for continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen as well as measurements made in the laboratory. It is one of the preferred methods for highly coloured and turbid waters, and also for analysis of waters not suitable for the Winkler titration method because of iron- and iodine-fixing substances, which can interfere in the iodometric method specified in ISO 5813.
The method is suitable for drinking waters, natural waters, waste waters, and saline waters. If used for saline waters such as sea or estuarine waters, a correction for salinity is essential for concentration measurement of oxygen.",https://www.iso.org/standard/59515.html

ISO,ISO 17183:2016,Soil quality  Screening soils for isopropanol-extractable organic compounds by determining emulsification index by light attenuation,"ISO 17183:2016 specifies the procedure to screen highly contaminated soils to detect organic compounds extractable with isopropanol, including a wide range of fuels, oils, and greases. The method is useful for finding hot spots. It is applicable both in laboratories and for site screening in the field. The working range is approximately 0,01 to 0,3 in absorbance units, corresponding to approximately 500 mg/kg to 10 000 mg/kg of isopropanol-extractable organic compounds in soil.
The light attenuation due to light scattering/absorption approach in this method is designed to quickly screen soil samples using calibration with the most appropriate substance(s) likely to be present on a given site to indicate the concentration levels.
This screening technique is applicable for a broad spectrum of organic compounds, mainly hydrocarbons. Organic compounds are a very broadly defined mixture of compounds, which show their own specific emulsification indices (see Annex A) and a gross emulsification index in a mixture sample, defined primarily by their insolubility in water. The more insoluble the compounds (e.g. non-polar compounds), the higher the response. Hydrocarbons are generally less-reactive and have little polarity. Determination of emulsification indexes uses their non-polar nature to detect organic compounds including a wide range of hydrocarbons from about C8 to about C36.
NOTE          This method can also be applied to biological substances such as vegetable oils.
This method is not applicable for determination of specific organic compounds or groups of compounds that may be part of a larger organic compound mixture. As with other screening techniques, it is advisable to confirm a certain percentage of both positive and negative test results, especially when near or above a regulatory action limit or when the presence of background or when interfering organic compounds such as surface active substances are suspected to be present.
This method does not address the evaporation of any volatile organic compound mixtures (i.e., gasoline) during sampling, preparation and detection. Although the screening method can be used for the quantitative detection of volatile hydrocarbons, it is not intended that the method be used for the quantitative determination of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons unless evaporation during sample handling is addressed; the response factor be appropriately corrected, or the method performance be demonstrated on real samples.
If emulsifiers or surface active substances (e.g. detergents) are present, significantly negatively-biased or false negative results can be obtained. If there is any evidence for the presence of surfactances in the soil, this method cannot be applied.",https://www.iso.org/standard/65917.html

The procedures to determine the performance characteristics are also specified. Furthermore, it describes methods and equipment to determine NH3 in flue gases including the sampling system and sample gas conditioning system.
It describes extractive systems, based on direct and indirect measurement methods, and in situ systems, based on direct measurement methods, in connection with a range of analysers that operate using, for example, the following principles:
-      ammonia conversion to, or reaction with NO, followed by chemiluminescence (CL) NOx difference measurement for ammonia (differential NOx);
-      ammonia conversion to, or reaction with NO, followed by non-dispersive ultraviolet (NDUV) spectroscopy NOx difference measurement for ammonia (differential NOx);
-      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy;
-      non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy with gas filter correlation (GFC);
-      tuneable laser spectroscopy (TLS).
The method allows continuous monitoring with permanently installed measuring systems of NH3 emissions, and is applicable to measurements of NH3 in dry or wet flue gases, for process monitoring, long term monitoring of the performance of deNOx systems and/or emission monitoring.
Other equivalent instrumental methods can be used, provided they meet the minimum requirements proposed in ISO 17179:2016. The measuring system can be calibrated with certified gases, in accordance with ISO 17179:2016, or comparable methods.
The differential NOx technique using CL has been successfully tested on some power plants where the NOx concentration and NH3 concentration in flue gas after deNOx systems are up to 50 mg (NO)/m3 and 10 mg (NH3)/m3, respectively. AMS based on FTIR, NDIR with GFC and TLS has been used successfully in this application for measuring ranges as low as 10 mg (NH3)/m3.",https://www.iso.org/standard/59257.html

ISO,ISO 16797:2004,Nuclear energy  Soxhlet-mode chemical durability test  Application to vitrified matrixes for high-level radioactive waste,"ISO 16797:2004 describes the Soxhlet-mode parameter test to assess the chemical durability of materials by measuring the initial dissolution rate in pure water. The measurement is performed at the boiling point of water, at which the dissolution rate is considerably higher than at room temperature. In most cases, the alteration phenomena are therefore significantly accelerated. The test is applicable to vitrified matrixes for high-level redioactive waste.
The test described in ISO 16797:2004 is intended to measure the initial dissolution rate; it is thus applicable only to nonporous materials (or materials with small, closed porosity) for which the primary alteration phenomenon is a surface reaction mechanism (diffusion mechanisms are involved in the dissolution of porous media). The test results can therefore be compared only with findings obtained for nonporous materials if serious errors of interpretation are to be avoided.
The resulting ""initial dissolution rate in pure boiling water at atmospheric pressure"" can be used to compare materials of the same type (e.g. oxides), provided their initial dissolution is governed by the same mechanism (e.g. surface reactions).
This parameter test cannot be used to assess the long-term behaviour of a material, which generally requires several tests, modelling and validation, as described, for example, in Standard ENV 12920.
This test is applicable to any glass, vitrified material (i.e. material resulting from a vitrification process) or nonporous oxide material with a morphology that allows the preparation of monolithic test coupons of known surface area. It determines the initial dissolution rate of the material in deionized water at the boiling point (approximately 100 Â°C) by analysis of the leaching solution and by measurement of the specimen mass loss.",https://www.iso.org/standard/31073.html

ISO 16702:2007 is appropriate for a wide range of organic compounds containing isocyanate functional groups, including isocyanate monomers and prepolymers. Monomers containing a single isocyanate moiety (e.g. methyl isocyanate, ethyl isocyanate, phenyl isocyanate, hexyl isocyanate) are produced during thermal degradation of polyurethanes, i.e. flame bonding and laser cutting. Isocyanate polymers, also called polyisocyanates, homopolymers, oligomers or prepolymers, are derived from the diisocyanate monomers by self-condensation or reaction with polyols. Polymeric diisocyanates are widely used in the polyurethanes, paints and coatings, and adhesives industries.
ISO 16702:2007 is appropriate for measuring any product containing free isocyanate groups. It was developed primarily for the commonly used methylenebis(phenylisocyanate) (MDI), 1,6-(diisocyanato)hexane (HDI), and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and their oligomers and polymers. It has also been used for isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hydrogenated methylenebis(phenylisocyanate) (HMDI), and naphthyldiisocyanate (NDI), and their oligomers and polymers.
The method is used to determine time-weighted average concentrations of organic isocyanates in workplace atmospheres, and is suitable for sampling over periods in the range 0,5 min to 8 h. The method is designed for personal monitoring, but can also be used for fixed location monitoring by suitable modification.
The method is suitable for the measurement of airborne organic isocyanates in the concentration range from approximately 0,1 Âµg/m3 to 140 Âµg/m3 for a 15 l sample volume.",https://www.iso.org/standard/42007.html

ISO,ISO 16646:2024,Fusion installations  Criteria for the design and operation of confinement and ventilation systems of tritium fusion facilities and fusion fuel handling facilities,"This document specifies the applicable requirements related to the design and the operation of confinement and ventilation systems for fusion facilities for tritium fuels and tritium fuel handling facilities specific for fusion applications for peaceful purposes using high tritium inventories, as well as for their specialized buildings such as hot cells, examination laboratories, emergency management centres, radioactive waste treatment and storage facilities.
In most countries, a tritium quantity is declared as high for tritium inventories higher than a range of 10Â g to 100Â g. In the tritium fusion facilities in the scope of this document, the tritium inventory is deemed to be higher than this range for the whole site.
This document applies especially to confinement and ventilation systems that ensure the safety function of nuclear facilities involved in nuclear fusion with the goal to protect the workers, the public and the environment from the dissemination of radioactive contamination originating from the operation of these installations, and in particular from airborne tritium contamination with adequate confinement systems.
The types of confinement systems for other facilities are covered by ISO 26802 for fission nuclear reactors, by ISO 17873 for facilities other than fission nuclear reactors and by ISO 16647 for nuclear worksite and for nuclear installations under decommissioning. The facilities covered by these three standards, notably ISO 17873, include tritium as a radioactive material among the ones to be confined, but tritium is not their driver of the risks for workers and for members of the public. Nevertheless, the tritium quantities and risks from fusion facilities create specificities for a specific standard (e.g. in fusion facilities, tritium is the driver of routine and accident consequences). Therefore, the scope of this document does not cover the other facilities involved in tritium releases (ISO 17873, ISO 16647 and ISOÂ 26802), even though these other facilities create tritium releases (e.g. non-reactor fission facilities, tritium laboratories, tritium removal facilities from fission plants, tritium defence facilities).",https://www.iso.org/standard/80264.html

They allow the calculation of the activity releases, in the gaseous effluent discharge from facilities producing positron emitting radionuclides and radiopharmaceuticals. Such facilities produce short-lived radionuclides used for medical purposes or research and can release gases typically including, but not limited to 18F, 11C, 15O and 13N. These facilities include accelerators, radiopharmacies, hospitals and universities. This document provides performanceâ€‘based criteria for the design and use of air monitoring equipment including probes, transport lines, sample monitoring instruments, and gas flow measuring methods. This document also provides information on monitoring program objectives, quality assurance, development of air monitoring control action levels, system optimisation and system performance verification.
The goal of achieving an unbiased measurement is accomplished either by direct (in-line) measurement on the exhaust stream or with samples extracted from the exhaust stream (bypass), provided that the radioactive gases are well mixed in the airstream. This document sets forth performance criteria and recommendations to assist in obtaining valid measurements.
NOTE 1 The criteria and recommendations of this document are aimed at monitoring which is conducted for regulatory compliance and system control. If existing air monitoring systems were not designed according to the performance criteria and recommendations of this document, an evaluation of the performance of the system is advised. If deficiencies are discovered based on a performance evaluation, a determination of the need for a system retrofit is to be made and corrective actions adopted where practicable.
NOTE 2 The criteria and recommendations of this document apply under both normal and offâ€‘normal operating conditions, provided that these conditions do not include production of aerosols or vapours.

ISO,ISO 16639:2017,Surveillance of the activity concentrations of airborne radioactive substances in the workplace of nuclear facilities,"ISO 16639:2017 provides guidelines and performance criteria for sampling airborne radioactive substances in the workplace. Emphasis is on health protection of workers in the indoor environment.
ISO 16639:2017 provides best practices and performance-based criteria for the use of air sampling devices and systems, including retrospective samplers and continuous air monitors. Specifically, this document covers air sampling program objectives, design of air sampling and monitoring programs to meet program objectives, methods for air sampling and monitoring in the workplace, and quality assurance to ensure system performance toward protecting workers against unnecessary inhalation exposures.
The primary purpose of the surveillance of airborne activity concentrations in the workplace is to evaluate and mitigate inhalation hazards to workers in facilities where these can become airborne. A comprehensive surveillance program can be used to
-      determine the effectiveness of administrative and engineering controls for confinement,
-      measure activity concentrations of radioactive substances,
-      alert workers to high activity concentrations in the air,
-      aid in estimating worker intakes when bioassay methods are unavailable,
-      determine signage or posting requirements for radiation protection, and
-      determine appropriate protective equipment and measures.
Air sampling techniques consist of two general approaches. The first approach is retrospective sampling, in which the air is sampled, the collection medium is removed and taken to a radiation detector system and analysed for radioactive substance, and the concentration results made available at a later time. In this context, the measured air concentrations are evaluated retrospectively. The second approach is continuous real-time air monitoring so that workers can be warned that a significant release of airborne radioactivity may have just occurred. In implementing an effective air sampling program, it is important to achieve a balance between the two general approaches. The specific balance depends on hazard level of the work and the characteristics of each facility.
A special component of the second approach which can apply, if properly implemented, is the preparation of continuous air monitoring instrumentation and protocols. This enables radiation protection monitoring of personnel that have been trained and fitted with personal protective equipment (PPE) that permit pre-planned, defined, extended stay time in elevated concentrations of airborne radioactive substances. Such approaches can occur either as part of a planned re-entry of a contaminated area following an accidental loss of containment for accident assessment and recovery, or part of a project which involves systematic or routine access to radioactive substances (e.g. preparing process material containing easily aerosolized components), or handling objects such as poorly characterized waste materials that may contain radioactive contaminants that could be aerosolized when handled during repackaging. In this special case, the role of continuous air monitoring is to provide an alert to health physics personnel that the air concentrations of concern have exceeded a threshold such that the planned level of protection afforded by PPE has been or could be exceeded. This level would typically be many 10's or 100's of times higher than the derived air concentration (DAC) established for unprotected workers. The monitoring alarm or alert would therefore be designed not to be confused with the normal monitoring alarm, and the action taken in response would be similarly targeted at the specific site and personnel involved.
The air sampling strategy should be designed to minimize internal exposures and balanced with social, technical, economic, practical, and public policy considerations that are associated with the use of the radioactive substance.
A comprehensive air sampling strategy should also consider that the air sampling program is only one element of a broader radiation protection program. Therefore, individuals involved with the air sampling program should interact with personnel working in other elements of the radiation protection program, such as contamination control and internal dosimetry.

ISO,ISO 16304:2018,Ships and marine technology  Marine environment protection  Arrangement and management of port waste reception facilities,"This document provides a method for addressing ship generated waste and cargo residues from when they are offloaded from the ship, to how they are managed ashore. The provision, operation and use of port reception facilities (PRFs) are inherently linked, so this document addresses the design of PRFs, and their operation and management. This document is designed to be used by ports and terminals with existing PRFs which aim to refine their systems; it can also be used by new ports and terminals that are developing PRFs.
Parties to MARPOL are obligated as Port States to ensure that port reception facilities (PRFs) adequate to meet the needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay are provided at their ports and terminals. MARPOL does not seek to regulate the management of ship generated waste and cargo residues at ports and terminals beyond the reception facility requirement. However, ports and terminals may need to consider national, regional and local regulations. While these regulations can exceed the scope of MARPOL, the IMO recognises the need to manage ship generated waste and cargo residues at ports and terminals as part of an environmentally sound management approach for avoiding, minimising, and eliminating pollution from ships.
In consideration of above, this document applies to the management of ship generated waste and cargo residues regulated by MARPOL that are discharged at ports and terminals. It also covers principles and issues that should be considered in the development of a PWMP, its implementation and PRF operations. The operation of any PRF is governed by the principles and procedures included in the PWMP. The procedures to operate the PRF and the development of a PWMP are closely linked and therefore are integrated into this document.
This document addresses the principles and issues that should be considered in:
â€”          The development of a port waste management strategy;
â€”          The design and operation of PRF;
â€”          PWMP development, implementation and compliance; and
â€”          PRF management and accountability.
This document has been designed to be used by ports and terminals of any size. It does not give specifics on the size or location of a PRF in each port, but provides a list of principles to be considered and applied to any size of type of port or terminal (e.g. marina, fishing port, container terminal, oil terminal, roll on/roll off terminal, cruise terminal, ferry terminal, bulk or general cargo terminal, ship repair or recycling facility, and offshore terminal).

ISO,ISO 16232:2018,Road vehicles  Cleanliness of components and systems,"This document specifies requirements for applying and documenting methods for determining particulate contamination on functionally-relevant components and systems (cleanliness inspection) of road vehicles.
A cleanliness inspection comprises the basis of an assessment of technical cleanliness, which is performed, for example, under the following circumstances:
â€”          initial inspection and evaluation;
â€”          inspection of incoming and outgoing components; and
â€”          quality control or monitoring of manufacturing processes relevant to cleanliness (e.g. cleaning, surface treatment and assembly processes).
This document is intended to improve the informative quality and comparability of test results. It also defines the standardized expression of cleanliness specifications and cleanliness test results in the quality chain of the automotive industry.
This document does not apply to the following:
â€”          detection of filmy contamination (grease, oils, etc.);
â€”          application of non-quantifiable particulate detection methods on test components (e.g. visual assessment, wipe test with clean cloth, etc.); and
â€”          characterization of operating fluids (fuel, oils, coolants, brake fluid, etc.).
This document does not define any cleanliness limit values for specific components or systems. The degree of cleanliness required for a specific component or system is dependent on a number of highly-individual factors. Cleanliness specifications are intended to be undertaken only by specialists who not only know the component concerned but also the system it is built into, the later conditions of use, technically-feasible practices and possible consequences for manufacturing processes and the supply chain.

ISO,ISO 16221:2001,Water quality  Guidance for determination of biodegradability in the marine environment,"This International Standard specifies five methods for determining the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic
compounds in the marine environment by aerobic microorganisms in static aqueous test systems. Standard
degradation methods developed for testing in fresh water are modified and adapted to marine conditions. These
methods are the DOC die-away test (ISO 7827), the closed bottle test (ISO 10707), the two-phase closed bottle
test (ISO 10708), the CO2 evolution test (ISO 9439) and the CO2 headspace test (ISO 14593).
The methods apply to organic compounds which
a) are water-soluble under the conditions of the test used;
b) are poorly water-soluble under the conditions of the test used, in which case special measures may be
necessary to achieve good dispersion of the compound (see for example, ISO 10634);
c) are volatile, provided that an appropriate test with suitable conditions is used;
d) are not inhibitory to the test microorganisms at the concentration chosen for the tests. The presence of
inhibitory effects can be determined as specified in this International Standard.
NOTE The conditions described in this International Standard do not always correspond to the optimal conditions for
allowing the maximum degree of biodegradation to occur. For biodegradation methods in fresh water see ISO 14593 and
ISO 15462, and for biodegradation at low concentrations see ISO 14592.",https://www.iso.org/standard/30205.html

in air.
This part of ISO 16200 is applicable to a wide range of VOCs, including hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons,
esters, glycol ethers, ketones and alcohols. A number of devices and sorbents are recommended for the sampling
of these VOCs, each sorbent having a different range of applicability.
NOTE Activated coconut shell charcoal is frequently used. Very polar compounds may require derivatization; very low
boiling compounds will only be partially retained by the sorbents and can only be estimated qualitatively. Semi-volatile
compounds will be fully retained by the sorbents, but may only be partially recovered.
This part of ISO 16200 is valid for the measurement of airborne vapours of VOCs in a concentration range of
approximately 1 mg/m3 to 1000 mg/m3 individual organic for an exposure time of 8 h.
The upper limit of the useful range is set by the sorptive capacity of the sorbent used and, subject to dilution of the
analysed solution, by the linear dynamic range of the gas chromatograph column and detector or by the sample
splitting capability of the analytical instrumentation used. The lower limit of the useful range depends on the noise
level of the detector and on blank levels of analyte and/or interfering artefacts on the sampling devices or in the
desorption solvent. Artefacts are typically sub-nanogram for activated charcoal, but higher levels of aromatic
hydrocarbons have been noted in some batches.",https://www.iso.org/standard/30188.html

ISO,ISO 16075-1:2020,Guidelines for treated wastewater use for irrigation projects  Part 1: The basis of a reuse project for irrigation,"This document contains guidelines for the development and the execution of projects intending to use treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation and considers the parameters of climate and soil.
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on all elements of a project using TWW for unrestricted and restricted irrigation, including design, materials, construction, and performance, when used for the following:
â€”     irrigation of agricultural crops;
â€”     irrigation of public and private gardens and landscape areas, including parks, sport fields, golf courses, cemeteries, etc.
These guidelines are intended to provide assistance for the benefit of users of TWW for irrigation. The guidelines relate to the widespread and common ranges of water quality rather than exceptional or unique ones and are intended for the use of professionals, such as irrigation companies (designers and operators), agricultural extension officers or advisors, water companies (designers and operators), local authorities and water utilities. The use of these guidelines by users might require additional specifications.
None of the parts of this document are intended to be used for certification purposes.
These guidelines suggest the parameters of TWW quality. These parameters include the following:
â€”     agronomic parameters: nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), salinity factors (total salt content, chloride, boron, and sodium concentration) and heavy metals' concentration;
â€”     pathogen presence.
Each of these parameters can have possible impacts on the crops, soil, and public health. The guidelines discuss the possibility of preventing the contaminants' addition during wastewater production and the ability to remove them during the course of treatment.
Contaminants of emerging concern (such as pharmaceuticals and personal care product residuals) are outside the scope of this document since up to day, there is no evidence of adverse effects on human health or environment via irrigation with TWW or via the consumption of crops irrigated with TWW.
The project should be designed in accordance with the sanitary quality of the TWW in order to avoid disease transmission by the pathogens in the water.
The use of these guidelines is encouraged to ensure consistency within any organization engaged in the use of treated wastewater.
These guidelines provide the basis for a healthy, hydrological, environmental and agronomic conscious design, operation, monitoring, and maintenance of an irrigation system using treated wastewater.",https://www.iso.org/standard/73482.html

ISO,ISO 16017-2:2003,Indoor ambient and workplace air  Sampling and analysis of volatile organic compounds by sorbent tube/thermal desorption/capillary gas chromatography  Part 2: Diffusive sampling,"ISO 16017-2:2003 gives general guidance for the sampling and analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. It is applicable to indoor, ambient and workplace air.
ISO 16017-2:2003 is applicable to a wide range of VOCs, including hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ester, glycol ethers, ketones and alcohols. A number of sorbents are recommended for the sampling of these VOCs, each sorbent having a different range of applicability. Very polar compounds generally require derivatisation; very low boiling compounds are only partially retained by the sorbents and can only be estimated qualitatively. Semi-volatile compounds are fully retained by the sorbents, but may only be partially recovered.
ISO 16017-2:2003 is applicable to the measurement of airborne vapours of VOCs in a concentration range of approximately 0,002 mg/m3 to 100 mg/m3 individual organic for an exposure time of 8 h, or 0,3 g/m3 to 300 g/m3 individual organic for an exposure time of four weeks.
The upper limit of the useful range is set by the sorptive capacity of the sorbent used and by the linear dynamic range of the gas chromatograph column and detector or by the sample splitting capability of the analytical instrumentation used. The lower limit of the useful range depends on the noise level of the detector and on blank levels of analyte and/or interfering artefacts on the sorbent tubes. Artefacts are typically sub-nanogram for well-conditioned Tenax GR and carbonaceous sorbents, carbonized molecular sieves and pure charcoals; at low nanogram levels for Tenax TA and at 5 ng to 50 ng levels for other porous polymers.",https://www.iso.org/standard/29195.html
ISO,ISO 16017-1:2000,Indoor ambient and workplace air  Sampling and analysis of volatile organic compounds by sorbent tube/thermal desorption/capillary gas chromatography  Part 1: Pumped sampling,"This part of ISO 16017 gives general guidance for the sampling and analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
in air. It is applicable to ambient, indoor and workplace atmospheres and the assessment of emissions from
materials in small- or full-scale test chambers.
This part of ISO 16017 is appropriate for a wide range of VOCs, including hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons,
esters, glycol ethers, ketones and alcohols. A number of sorbents 1) are recommended for the sampling of
these VOCs, each sorbent having a different range of applicability. Very polar compounds will generally require
derivatization, very low boiling compounds will only be partially retained by the sorbents, depending on ambient
temperature, and can only be estimated qualitatively. Semi-volatile compounds will be fully retained by the
sorbents, but may only be partially recovered. Compounds for which this part of ISO 16017 has been tested are
given in tables. This part of ISO 16017 may be applicable to compounds not listed, but in these cases it is
advisable to use a back-up tube containing the same or a stronger sorbent.
This part of ISO 16017 is applicable to the measurement of airborne vapours of VOCs in a concentration range of
approximately 0,5 _g/ m3 to 100 mg/m3 individual compound.
The upper limit of the useful range is set by the sorptive capacity of the sorbent used and by the linear dynamic
range of the gas chromatograph column and detector or by the sample-splitting capability of the analytical
instrumentation used. The sorptive capacity is measured as a breakthrough volume of air, which determines the
maximum air volume that shall not be exceeded when sampling.
The lower limit of the useful range depends on the noise level of the detector and on blank levels of analyte and/or
interfering artefacts on the sorbent tubes. Artefacts are typically sub-nanogram for well-conditioned Tenax GR and
carbonaceous sorbents such as Carbopack/Carbotrap type materials, carbonized molecular sieves and molecular
sieves such as Spherocarb, or pure charcoal; at low nanogram levels for Tenax TA and at 5 ng to 50 ng levels for
other porous polymers such as Chromosorbs and Porapaks. Sensitivity is typically limited to 0,5 _g/m_ for 10-litre
air samples with this latter group of sorbents because of their inherent high background.
The procedure specified in this part of ISO 16017 is applicable to low flowrate personal sampling pumps and gives
a time-weighted average result. It is not applicable to the measurement of instantaneous or short-term fluctuations
in concentration.
1) The sorbents listed in annex C and elsewhere in this International Standard are those known to perform as specified under
this part of ISO 16017. Each sorbent or product that is identified by a trademarked name is unique and has a sole manufacturer;
however, they are widely available from many different suppliers. This information is given for the convenience of users of this

Sensory testing can be performed on site or in laboratories; in the latter case, by means of air in sampling containers which were collected from the site.
The olfactory testing is appropriate for office and administration buildings, assembly halls, residential buildings, and other habitable rooms in which the comfort and health of the occupants is of interest. The test criteria in ISO 16000-30:2014 specifies are not applicable to factory buildings and workshops or other rooms in which odours unavoidably stem from the production processes (kitchens, bakeries etc.). If an odour evaluation of such rooms is undertaken without the odour-producing processes, it is necessary to take into account that there is a possibility that the processes have influenced and changed the odour of the room through the adsorption of odorous compounds.
Sensory odour tests of indoor air can meet a variety of objectives. These include finding the cause(s) of unpleasant or objectionable odours, determining the reasonability of odours and the usability of affected rooms, and inspecting the results of renovation work. When seeking the cause of odours, it is wise to conduct additional laboratory tests on samples of the component materials according to ISO 16000â€‘28.

It is primarily applicable to indoor areas, but it is also suitable for certain outdoor situations. A sampling technique for collection of settled dust using adhesive tape is described. The method incorporates an analytical method for evaluation of the collected samples by scanning electron microscopy. The result can be specified in asbestos structures per unit area and/or classified into four different loading classes. The analytical sensitivity depends on the area examined and can be as low as 10 structures/cm2.
For the purpose of ISO 16000-27:2014, an asbestos or fibrous structure is defined as an asbestos or (other inorganic/organic) fibre-containing particle regardless of its diameter.

ISO,ISO 16000-1:2004,Indoor air  Part 1: General aspects of sampling strategy,"ISO 16000-1:2004 is intended to aid the planning of indoor pollution monitoring. 
Before a sampling strategy is devised for indoor air monitoring, it is necessary to clarify for what purposes, when, where, how often and over what periods of time monitoring is to be performed. The answers to these questions depend, in particular, on a number of special characteristics of the indoor environments, on the objective of the measurement and, finally, on the environment to be measured. ISO 16000-1:2004 deals with the significance of these factors and offers suggestions on how to develop a suitable sampling strategy.
ISO 16000-1:2004 is applicable to indoor environments such as dwellings having living rooms, bedrooms, do-it-yourself rooms, recreation rooms and cellars, kitchens and bathrooms; workrooms or work places in buildings which are not subject to health and safety inspections in regard to air pollutants (for example, offices, sales premises); public buildings (for example hospitals, schools, kindergartens, sports halls, libraries, restaurants and bars, theatres, cinemas and other function rooms), and also cabins of vehicles.",https://www.iso.org/standard/39844.html

ISO,ISO 14966:2019,Ambient air  Determination of numerical concentration of inorganic fibrous particles  Scanning electron microscopy method,"This document specifies a method using scanning electron microscopy for determination of the concentration of inorganic fibrous particles in the air. The method specifies the use of gold-coated, capillary-pore, track-etched membrane filters, through which a known volume of air has been drawn. Using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the method can discriminate between fibres with compositions consistent with those of the asbestos varieties (e.g. serpentine and amphibole), gypsum, and other inorganic fibres. Annex C provides a summary of fibre types which can be measured.
This document is applicable to the measurement of the concentrations of inorganic fibrous particles in ambient air. The method is also applicable for determining the numerical concentrations of inorganic fibrous particles in the interior atmospheres of buildings, for example to determine the concentration of airborne inorganic fibrous particles remaining after the removal of asbestos-containing products.
The range of concentrations for fibres with lengths greater than 5 Âµm, in the range of widths which can be detected under standard measurement conditions (see 7.2), is approximately 3 fibres to 200 fibres per square millimetre of filter area. The air concentrations, in fibres per cubic metre, represented by these values are a function of the volume of air sampled.
The ability of the method to detect and classify fibres with widths lower than 0,2 Âµm is limited. If airborne fibres in the atmosphere being sampled are predominantly <0,2 Âµm in width, a transmission electron microscopy method such as ISO 10312[8] can be used to determine the smaller fibres.",https://www.iso.org/standard/75583.html

Following this, peroxide sulfur (SP), calcium (CaP) and magnesium (MgP) are determined. On samples where jarosite is present, or where pHKCl is < 4,5, residual acid soluble sulfur (SRAS) is determined on the soil residue remaining after peroxide digestion. Titratable sulfidic acidity (TSA), reacted calcium (CaA), reacted magnesium (MgA) and peroxide oxidizable sulfur (SPOS) are then determined by difference. For peat samples containing substantial levels of organic sulfur, the SPOCAS suite is generally unsuitable for estimating sulfide content, and the chromium reducible suite of procedures should be used instead.",https://www.iso.org/standard/54710.html

On a separate test portion of soil, the pH in a 1 mol/l KCl soil suspension (pHKCl) is determined. When pHKCl is < 6,5, titratable actual acidity (TAA) is then determined. Subsequently, potassium chloride extractable sulfur (SKCl), calcium (CaKCl), and magnesium (MgKCl) can also be determined. Where jarosite is identified in the soil (or where pHKCl is < 4,5), net acid-soluble sulfur (SNAS) is determined by the difference between hydrochloric acid extractable sulfur (SHCl) and potassium chloride extractable sulfur.

ISO,ISO 14051:2011,Environmental management  Material flow cost accounting  General framework,"ISO 14051:2011 provides a general framework for material flow cost accounting (MFCA). Under MFCA, the flows and stocks of materials within an organization are traced and quantified in physical units (e.g. mass, volume) and the costs associated with those material flows are also evaluated. The resulting information can act as a motivator for organizations and managers to seek opportunities to simultaneously generate financial benefits and reduce adverse environmental impacts. MFCA is applicable to any organization that uses materials and energy, regardless of their products, services, size, structure, location, and existing management and accounting systems.
MFCA can be extended to other organizations in the supply chain, both upstream and downstream, thus helping to develop an integrated approach to improving material and energy efficiency in the supply chain. This extension can be beneficial because waste generation in an organization is often driven by the nature or quality of materials provided by a supplier, or the specification of the product requested by a customer.
By definition, management accounting and environmental management accounting (EMA) focus on providing organizations with information for internal decision-making. MFCA, one of the major tools of EMA, also focuses on information for internal decision-making, and is intended to complement existing environmental management and management accounting practices. Although an organization can choose to include external costs in an MFCA analysis, external costs are outside the scope of ISO 14051:2011.

This document covers people of 14 years and older (the 5th percentile stature of 14-year-olds is approximately 1 400 mm). In addition, for upper limbs only, it provides information for children older than 3 years (5th percentile stature of 3-year-olds is approximately 900 mm) where reaching through openings needs to be addressed.
NOTE 1  It is not practical to specify safety distances for all persons. Therefore, the values presented are intended to cover the 95th percentile of the population.
Data for preventing lower limb access for children is not considered.
The distances apply when sufficient risk reduction can be achieved by distance alone. Because safety distances depend on size, some people of extreme dimensions will still be able to reach hazard zones even when the requirements of this document are met.
Compliance with the requirements in this document will prevent access to the hazard zone. Nevertheless the user of this document is advised that it does not provide the required risk reduction for every hazard (e.g. hazards related to machine emissions such as ionizing radiation, heat sources, noise, dust).

The information generated from this test may also be applicable to the scenario of an external fire impinging on a faÃ§ade; however, the results may not be applicable for all fire exposure conditions.
This method is applicable only to faÃ§ades and claddings that are non-loadbearing. No attempt is made to determine the structural strength of the faÃ§ade or cladding.
This test is not intended to determine the fire behaviour of a given building faÃ§ade. Details such as balconies, windows, window shutters, curtains, etc., are not considered in this test. This test does not include the risk of fire spread e.g. through the window details of the faÃ§ade system as it only is constructed as a faÃ§ade wall. There is clear evidence that an internal corner (also called a re-entrant corner) configuration produces a more intense fire exposure than a flat faÃ§ade. The most commonly encountered internal re-entrant corner is with an angle of 90Â°. The test faÃ§ade specimen therefore contains an internal corner with a re-entrant angle of 90Â°.

The growth rate of anaerobic bacteria is much lower compared with that of aerobic microorganisms. For this reason, the test periods are longer for anaerobic methods than those used for aerobic bacteria.
This method is applicable to substances, soluble or insoluble in water, including volatile chemicals. 
Note that special care is necessary with compounds of low water-solubility, and in these cases, other methods might be more suitable.
This method can provide information that is useful in predicting the likely effect of a test material on biogas production in anaerobic digesters. For example, only longer tests, which simulate working digesters more closely can indicate whether adaptation of the microorganisms to the test material can occur or whether compounds likely to be adsorbed onto sludge can build up to a toxic concentration over a longer period than allowed in this test.
Information obtained by ISO 13641-1:2003 can also be helpful in choosing suitable initial mass concentrations for anaerobic biodegradability tests (e.g. ISO 11734).

ISO,ISO 13571:2012,Life-threatening components of fire  Guidelines for the estimation of time to compromised tenability in fires,"ISO 13571:2012 is one of many tools available for use in fire safety engineering. It is intended to be used in conjunction with models for analysis of the initiation and development of fire, fire spread, smoke formation and movement, chemical species generation, transport and decay, and people movement, as well as fire detection and suppression. ISO 13571:2012 is to be used only within this context.
ISO 13571:2012 is intended to address the consequences of human exposure to the life-threatening components of fire. The time-dependent concentrations of fire effluents and the thermal environment of a fire are determined by the rate of fire growth, the yields of the various fire gases produced from the involved fuels, the decay characteristics of those fire gases and the ventilation pattern. Once these are determined, the methodology presented in ISO 13571:2012 can be used for the estimation of the time at which individuals can be expected to experience compromised tenability.
With care, this guidance can also be applied to estimation of the time limit for rescuing people who are immobile due to injury, medical condition, etc.
ISO 13571:2012 establishes procedures to evaluate the life-threatening components of fire hazard analysis in terms of the status of exposed human subjects at discrete time intervals. It makes possible the estimation of the time at which occupants can experience compromised tenability. It enables estimation of a compromised tenability endpoint for each of the fire effluent components, with the most important endpoint being the earliest to occur.
Although the concept of compromised tenability is consistent with the definition of incapacitation (see ISO 13943), the latter term is not used in ISO 13571:2012 due to its potentially broad interpretation to include many effects, including collapse and unconsciousness, that are not addressed. ISO 13571:2012 focuses specifically on compromised tenability as influenced by both physiological and behavioural responses resulting from exposure to a fire's life-threatening components.
The life-threatening components addressed include fire-effluent toxicity, heat, and visual obscuration due to smoke. In cases where the effluent composition is available, the toxic gas model is to be used for assessment of fire-effluent toxicity. For those cases where the effluent composition is unknown, an additional mass-loss model using generic toxic potency values is provided.",https://www.iso.org/standard/56172.html

ISO,ISO 13506-1:2024,Protective clothing against heat and flame  Part 1: Test method for complete garments  Measurement of transferred energy using an instrumented manikin,"This document specifies the overall requirements, equipment and calculation methods to provide results that can be used for evaluating the performance of complete garments or protective clothing ensembles exposed to short duration flame engulfment.
This test method establishes a rating system to characterize the thermal protection provided by single-layer and multi-layer garments made of flame resistant materials. The rating is based on the measurement of heat transfer to a full-size manikin exposed to convective and radiant energy in a laboratory simulation of a fire with controlled heat flux, duration and flame distribution. The heat transfer data is summed over a prescribed time to give the total transferred energy. Transferred energy and thermal manikin protection factor (TMPF) assessment methods provide a means to quantify product performance.
The exposure heat flux is limited to a nominal level of 84Â kW/m2 and durations of 3Â s to 20Â s dependant on the risk assessment and expectations from the thermal insulating capability of the garment.
The results obtained apply only to the particular garments or ensembles, as tested, and for the specified conditions of each test, particularly with respect to the heat flux, duration and flame distribution.
This test method covers visual evaluation, observation, inspection and documentation on the overall behaviour of the test specimen(s) before, during and after the exposure. The effects of body position and movement are not addressed in this test method.
The heat flux measurements can also be used to calculate the predicted skin burn injury resulting from the exposure (see ISOÂ 13506-2).
This test method does not simulate high radiant exposures such as those found in arc flash exposures, some types of fire exposures where liquid or solid fuels are involved, nor exposure to nuclear explosions.
NOTEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This test method is complex and requires a high degree of technical expertise in both the test setup and operation. Even minor deviations from the instructions in this test method can lead to significantly different test results.",https://www.iso.org/standard/75863.html

ISO,ISO 13344:2015,Estimation of the lethal toxic potency of fire effluents,"ISO 13344:2015 provides a means for estimating the lethal toxic potency of the fire effluent produced from a material while exposed to the specific combustion conditions of a physical fire model. The lethal toxic potency values are specifically related to the fire model selected, the exposure scenario and the material evaluated.
Lethal toxic potency values associated with 30-min exposures of rats are predicted using calculations which employ combustion atmosphere analytical data for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) (vitiation) and, if present, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen fluoride (HF), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), acrolein and formaldehyde. The chemical composition of the test specimen may suggest additional combustion products to be quantified and included. If the fire effluent toxic potency cannot be attributed to the toxicants analysed, this is an indication that other toxicants or factors must be considered.
ISO 13344:2015 is applicable to the estimation of the lethal toxic potency of fire effluent atmospheres produced from materials, products or assemblies under controlled laboratory conditions and should not be used in isolation to describe or appraise the toxic hazard or risk of materials, products or assemblies under actual fire conditions. However, results of this test may be used as elements of a fire hazard assessment that takes into account all of the factors which are pertinent to an assessment of the fire hazard of a particular end use; see ISO 19706.
The intended use of fire safety-engineering calculations is for life-safety prediction for people and is most frequently for time intervals somewhat shorter than 30 min. This extrapolation across species and exposure intervals is outside the scope of ISO 13344:2015.

ISO,ISO 12846:2012,Water quality  Determination of mercury  Method using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) with and without enrichment,"ISO 12846:2012 specifies two methods for the determination of mercury in drinking, surface, ground, rain and waste water after appropriate pre-digestion. For the first method, an enrichment step by amalgamation of the Hg on, for example, a gold/platinum adsorber is used. For the second method, the enrichment step is omitted.
The choice of method depends on the equipment available, the matrix and the concentration range of interest. Both methods are suitable for the determination of mercury in water. The method with enrichment commonly has a practical working range from 0,01 Âµg/l to 1 Âµg/l. The mean limit of quantification (LOQ) reported by the participants of the validation trial was 0,008 Âµg/l. This information on the LOQ gives the user of ISO 12846:2012 an orientation and does not replace the estimation of performance data from laboratory specific data. It has to be considered that it is possible to achieve lower LOQs with specific instrumentation (e.g. single mercury analysers).
The method without enrichment commonly has a practical working range starting at 0,05 Âµg/l. The LOQ reported by the participants of the validation trial was 0,024 Âµg/l. It is up to the user, based on the specific application, to decide whether higher concentrations are determined by omitting the enrichment step and/or by diluting the sample(s). The sensitivity of both methods is dependent on the selected operating conditions.
Another possibility for the determination of extremely low Hg concentrations down to 0,002 Âµg/l without pre-concentration is the application of atomic fluorescence spectrometry (see ISO 17852). Specific atomic-absorption mercury analysers allow determinations down to 0,010 Âµg/l without pre-concentration.
In general, the determination of trace concentrations of Hg by AAS (or AFS) is dependent on clean operating conditions in the laboratory and on the use of high-purity chemicals with negligible low-Hg blanks.
Note that ISO 12846:2012 may be applied to industrial and municipal waste water after an additional digestion step performed under appropriate conditions and after suitable method validation.

It complements ISO 12828â€‘1, which deals with limits of quantification and detection.
The tools and techniques described can be applied to the measurement of quantities, concentrations (molar and mass), volume fractions, and concentration or volume fraction versus time analyses. Fire effluents are often a complex matrix of chemical species, strongly dependent on the materials involved in the fire, but also dependent on fire scenario parameters (see ISO 19706). With such a wide variety of conditions, the analytical techniques available will differ in terms of the influence of the matrix on the methods and on the concentration ranges which can be measured. The analytical techniques available are likely to differ significantly in several respects, such as their sensitivity to the matrix and the range of concentrations/volume fractions which can be reliably measured. For these reasons, a unique reference analytical technique for every fire effluent of interest is, in practical terms, difficult or impossible to achieve. The tools in this document allow verification of the reliable measurement ranges and conditions for the analysis of fire effluents, thereby enabling a comparison among various analytical techniques.
Examples of existing International Standards where the information contained in this document can be used are the analytical chemical methods in ISO 19701, ISO 19702, ISO 5660â€‘1, and the chemical measurements in the methods discussed in ISO/TR 16312â€‘2, ISO 16405, or their application to fire toxicity assessment using ISO 13571 and ISO 13344.

ISO,ISO 12807:2018,Safe transport of radioactive materials  Leakage testing on packages,"This document specifies gas leakage test criteria and test methods for demonstrating that packages used to transport radioactive materials comply with the package containment requirements defined in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material for:
â€”          design verification;
â€”          fabrication verification;
â€”          preshipment verification;
â€”          periodic verification;
â€”          maintenance verification.
This document describes a method for relating permissible activity release of the radioactive contents carried within a containment system to equivalent gas leakage rates under specified test conditions. This approach is called gas leakage test methodology. However, in this document it is recognized that other methodologies might be acceptable, provided that they demonstrate that any release of the radioactive contents will not exceed the regulatory requirements, and subject to agreement with the competent authority.
This document provides both overall and detailed guidance on the complex relationships between an equivalent gas leakage test and a permissible activity release rate. Whereas the overall guidance is universally agreed upon, the use of the detailed guidance shall be agreed upon with the competent authority during the Type B(U), Type B(M) or Type C packages certification process.
It should be noted that, for a given package, demonstration of compliance is not limited to a single methodology.
While this document does not require particular gas leakage test procedures, it does present minimum requirements for any test that is to be used. It is the responsibility of the package designer or consignor to estimate or determine the maximum permissible release rate of radioactivity to the environment and to select appropriate leakage test procedures that have adequate sensitivity.
This document pertains specifically to Type B(U), Type B(M) or Type C packages for which the regulatory containment requirements are specified explicitly.",https://www.iso.org/standard/50162.html

(By convention, 100 Â°C is set as the higher temperature.) 
The test is performed in small emission test chambers (small chambers). These small chambers are intended to provide a transfer function for vehicle level emissions. This method is intended for evaluating new car interior trim components but can, in principle, be applied to used car components.
The specified analytical procedure for SVOCs and semi-volatile carbonyls is ISO 16000â€‘6.

The method is applicable to all types of waters with a dry residue of less than 5 g/l and when no correction for colour quenching is necessary.
Gross alpha and gross beta activity measurement is not intended to give an absolute determination of the activity concentration of all alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides in a test sample, but is a screening analysis to ensure particular reference levels of specific alpha and beta emitters have not been exceeded. This type of determination is also known as gross alpha and beta index. Gross alpha and beta analysis is not expected to be as accurate nor as precise as specific radionuclide analysis after radiochemical separations.
The method covers non-volatile radionuclides below 80 Â°C, since some gaseous or volatile radionuclides (e.g. radon and radioiodine) can be lost during the source preparation.
The method is applicable to test samples of drinking water, rain water, surface and ground water as well as cooling water, industrial water, domestic and industrial waste water after proper sampling and test sample preparation (filtration when necessary and taking into account the amount of dissolved material in the water).

ISO,ISO 10704:2019,Water quality  Gross alpha and gross beta activity  Test method using thin source deposit,"This document specifies a method for the determination of gross alpha and gross beta activity concentration for alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. Gross alpha and gross beta activity measurement is not intended to give an absolute determination of the activity concentration of all alpha and beta emitting radionuclides in a test sample, but is a screening analysis to ensure particular reference levels of specific alpha and beta emitters have not been exceeded. This type of determination is also known as gross alpha and gross beta index. Gross alpha and gross beta analysis is not expected to be as accurate nor as precise as specific radionuclide analysis after radiochemical separations.
Maximum beta energies of approximately 0,1 MeV or higher are well measured. It is possible that low energy beta emitters can not detected (e.g. 3H, 55Fe, 241Pu) or can only be partially detected (e.g. 14C, 35S, 63Ni, 210Pb, 228Ra).
The method covers non-volatile radionuclides, since some gaseous or volatile radionuclides (e.g. radon and radioiodine) can be lost during the source preparation.
The method is applicable to test samples of drinking water, rainwater, surface and ground water as well as cooling water, industrial water, domestic and industrial wastewater after proper sampling, sample handling, and test sample preparation (filtration when necessary and taking into account the amount of dissolved material in the water).
The method described in this document is applicable in the event of an emergency situation, because the results can be obtained in less than 1 h. Detection limits reached for gross alpha and gross beta are less than 10 Bq/l and 20 Bq/l respectively. The evaporation of 10 ml sample is carried out in 20 min followed by 10 min counting with window-proportional counters.

The method is applicable to test samples of drinking water, rainwater, surface and ground water as well as cooling water, industrial water, domestic and industrial wastewater after proper sampling, sample handling, and test sample preparation (filtration when necessary and taking into account the amount of dissolved material in the water). This method is only applicable to homogeneous samples or samples which are homogeneous via timely filtration.
The lowest limit that can be measured without concentration of the sample or by using only passive shield of the detection system is about 5Â·10-2Â Bq/l for e.g. 137Cs.1 The upper limit of the activity corresponds to a dead time of 10 %. Higher dead times may be used but evidence of the accuracy of the dead-time correction is required.
Depending on different factors, such as the energy of the gamma-rays, the emission probability per nuclear disintegration, the size and geometry of the sample and the detector, the shielding, the counting time and other experimental parameters, the sample may require to be concentrated by evaporation if activities below 5Â·10-2Â Bq/l need to be measured. However, volatile radionuclides (e.g. radon and radioiodine) can be lost during the source preparation.
This method is suitable for application in emergency situations.

This document specifies technical requirements, acceptance criteria, and a validation test for dynamic dummies representing the human body in two mass groups: lightweight (52Â kgÂ toÂ 55Â kg) and heavyweight (98Â kgÂ toÂ 115Â kg). It only applies to passive and active dynamic dummies used for vibration tests of vehicle seats in the Z-axis (vertical) direction.
This document defines, for the two mass groups, the biodynamic response characteristics that the dynamic dummies are required to reproduce to represent those of the participants to be replaced. This document gives guidance on conducting future research to explore the degree of convergence that can be reached when the dynamic performance of seats is measured with participants and with dynamic dummies conforming to this document.
NOTEÂ 1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For seat testing, results have shown that the benefit of using a dynamic dummy is highly dependent on the excitation and dynamic characteristics of the seats. Depending on the type of vibration excitation applied, studies have suggested that the use of dynamic dummies can show benefit over an inert mass of equivalent weight only when testing suspension seats with higher natural frequency (>2Â Hz).

ISO 10295-1:2007 assesses the effect of such penetrations on the integrity and insulation performance of the element concerned, the integrity and insulation performance of the penetration sealing system, the insulation performance of the penetrating service or services, and where appropriate, the integrity failure of a service.
ISO 10295-1:2007 does not provide information concerning the influence of the inclusion of such penetrations and sealing systems on the load-bearing capacity of the element.
It is possible that a penetration seal is a component of, or contributes to the performance of, a system to which special requirements apply. In such cases additional tests, relevant to the system and its function, can be necessary. Examples are chimneys and fire-rated ducts in air distribution systems.

ISO,IEC 62321-11:2023,Determination of certain substances in electrotechnical products  Part 11: Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) in plastics by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS),"This part of IECÂ 62321 specifies two different techniques for the determination of tris(2â€‘chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) in plastics, the GC-MS or LC-MS method, both of which are applicable to quantitative analysis. 
These two techniques are applicable to use with polyurethane, polyvinylchloride, and polyethylene materials containing TCEP between 200 mg/kg to 2 000 mg/kg. 
These test methods do not apply to plastic materials having a processing temperature higher than 230Â Â°C.
GC-MS using a pyrolyser/thermal desorption accessory (Py/TD-GC-MS) technique is described in AnnexÂ A and can be used for the screening of TCEP in plastics. 
NOTEâ€ƒTCEP starts thermal decomposition at approximately 230Â Â°C. Polymer types that have a processing temperature into shapes of plastics (e.g. pellets, moulded parts or sheets) not exceeding the decomposition temperature can contain TCEP.",https://www.iso.org/standard/77055.html
