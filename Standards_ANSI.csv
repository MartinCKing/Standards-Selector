This arises from a combination of causes. Firstly, the image receptor MANUFACTURER and the X-RAY EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER may be different. Secondly a change in image receptor or film processing chemistry may alter the system performance. When system integration such as the above occurs, it is important that acceptance testing is performed.*When a change occurs which could alter system performance, it is essential that the system integrator (i.e. whoever is responsible for this change) discusses the implication of their change with the X-RAY EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER so that the latter can adjust the imaging system if necessary.*ACCEPTANCE TESTING of mammographic X-RAY EQUIPMENT requires average skill in medical physics.

The scope of this document is also limited to measuring image quality characteristics in images acquired on TEST DEVICES, not in PATIENT images.
The measurement procedures specified in this document are directed to
   MANUFACTURERS, who can demonstrate compliance by performing ACCEPTANCE and CONSTANCY TESTS as described by this document,
   test houses, who can confirm performance of MR EQUIPMENT using methods described in this document,
   regulatory authorities, who can reference this document, and
   RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONS who want to perform ACCEPTANCE and CONSTANCY TESTS using methods described in this document.
The essential image quality parameters and measurement methodologies defined in this document are
   SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO,
   UNIFORMITY,
   SLICE THICKNESS in 2-D scanning,
   2-D GEOMETRIC DISTORTION,
   SPATIAL RESOLUTION, and
   GHOSTING ARTEFACTS.
Each of these procedures can be performed standalone or in combination with any of the other procedures.
This document describes the preferred measurement procedures. It also describes alternative normative methods in Annex A. The preferred test methods may be substituted with these alternative normative methods. If necessary, other methods not described in this document can be used, provided those other test methods are documented and validated against the methods described in the document: it means an analysis is done by comparison to the original method that demonstrates a similar, or better, level of sensitivity to the same parameter of interest and a similar, or better, level of robustness against unrelated parameters. All methods will produce quantitative results.
The rationale to the preferred and alternate methods, and their pitfalls, are described in Annex B.
This document also presents requirements for CONSTANCY TESTS suitable for MR EQUIPMENT quality assurance programs concerning essential image quality parameters. There are no preferred CONSTANCY TEST methods, to provide flexibility in using existing automated procedures where available, but suggested examples of test methods can be found in Annex A. This document places an emphasis on consistently repeatable, automated measuring tools that facilitate trend analysis and the frequent quick testing of a small set of important parameters that are sensitive to the overall operating characteristics of the MR EQUIPMENT.

ISO/IEC,ISO/IEC 12087-3:1995,Information technology - Computer graphics and image processing - Image Processing and Interchange (IPI) - Functional specification - Part 3: Image Interchange Facility (IIF),"""This part of ISO/IEC 12087 facilitates the interchange of digital images. For this purpose, conceptual, architectural, and functional definitions of the Image Interchange Facility (IPI-IIF) are established. ISO/IEC 12087-3 consists of two major parts, the:IIF data format (IIF-DF) definition (by means of a formal syntax, described according to the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN. 1) -- refer to clause 5), and theIIF Gateway definition (by means of a manual page description of the functionality of an Application Program Interface (API) -- refer to clause 7).An IPI-IIF-conformant implementation has to fulfill the functionality specification of the IIF Gateway, as outlined in clause 7. Besides the IIF Gateway, there may be information processing systems (software such as parsers, generators, etc.) which read and/or write the IIF-DF.The IPI-IIF is based on the definitions described in ISO/IEC 12087-1, the &#8220;Common Architecture for Imaging&#8221;. The IPI-IIF, as a whole, may be characterized briefly as follows:By means of the IIF data format and Gateway, image data objects and image-related data objects are transported to and from application environments.By means of the full PIKS profile of the IPI-IIF data format (i.e., a format for data interchange between IPI-IIF and IPI-PIKS), image data objects and image-related data objects are imported to and exported from the Programmer""s Imaging Kernel System (IPI-PIKS), defined in ISO/IEC 12087-2.The IPI-IIF facilitates the storage of image data objects and image-related data objects in a variety of pre-defined storage modalities, including different periodicity organizations, such as pixel-interleaving or band-interleaving.This part of ISOiIEC 12087 defines syntax of image data (and image-related data) streams. The encoding of IIF data types is defined in ISO/IEC 12089. See also 5.3.3.The IPI-IIF supports a concept of standardized conformance profiles. Initially, three conformance profiles are defined within ISO/IEC 12087.An IIF data stream may be stored in devices such as file systems. An IIF data stream may beinterchanged and communicated in data networks (e.g., LANs and WANs) or in other data communication facilities. All low-level data storage and transfer is delegated, for instance, to the operating system of the target hardware.The IIF Gateway performs compression and decompression of image data objects using standardized compression and decompression techniques. These techniques are referenced in this part of ISO/IEC 12087. See 1.45 and 5.3.3 and 7.5 for further definition.The IIF Gateway is accessible via an API to perform image interchange functions. See clause 7 for a definition of IIF Gateway functionality.Reference shall be made to this part of ISO/IEC 12087, and its definitions shall be employed, whenever images are interchanged, according to the IPI-IIF, among different imaging applications environments or among imaging devices. The IPI-IIF is applicable to scenarios requiring the interchange of digital images, as outlined in Annex C.The use of the IIF data format as a superset of the functionality of most of the existing image interchange formats solves the problem of application-independent syntactical and semantical interpretation and understanding of image data.The IPI-IIF is applicable to image interchange in and among different application domains. The following application areas have been considered:Medical imagingRemote sensingPublishingIndustrial visionComputer graphics artsComputer animationScientific visualizationMission planningDocument processingOutdoor scene surveillanceThe limiting of the IPI-IIF scope to certain application domains is a matter of profiling.
