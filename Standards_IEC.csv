IEC,IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV,Explosive atmospheres - Part 10-1: Classification of areas - Explosive gas atmospheres,"""IEC 60079-10-1:2020 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between IEC 60079-10-1:2020 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60079-10-1:2015 edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 31J experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2021 have been included in this copy. IEC 60079-10-1:2020 is concerned with the classification of areas where flammable gas or vapour hazards may arise and may then be used as a basis to support the proper design, construction, operation and maintenance of equipment for use in hazardous areas. It is intended to be applied where there may be an ignition hazard due to the presence of flammable gas or vapour, mixed with air, but it does not apply to: a) mines susceptible to firedamp; b) the processing and manufacture of explosives; c) catastrophic failures or rare malfunctions which are beyond the concept of normality dealt with in this standard; d) rooms used for medical purposes; e) domestic premises; f) where a hazard may arise due to the presence of combustible dusts or combustible flyings but the principles may be used in assessment of a hybrid mixture. Flammable mists may form or be present at the same time as flammable vapour. In such case the strict application of the details in this document may not be appropriate. Flammable mists may also form when liquids not considered to be a hazard due to the high flash point are released under pressure. In these cases the classifications and details given in this document do not apply. For the purpose of this document, an area is a three-dimensional region or space. Atmospheric conditions include variations above and below reference levels of 101,3 kPa (1 013 mbar) and 20  C (293 K), provided that the variations have a negligible effect on the explosion properties of the flammable substances. In any site, irrespective of size, there may be numerous sources of ignition apart from those associated with equipment. Appropriate precautions will be necessary to ensure safety in this context. This standard is applicable with judgement for other ignition sources but in some applications other safeguards may also need to be considered. E.g. larger distances may apply for naked flames when considering hot work permits. This document does not take into account the consequences of ignition of an explosive atmosphere except where a zone is so small that if ignition did occur it would have negligible consequences. This third edition of IEC 60079-10-1 cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2015, and constitutes a technical revision, see foreword for further details.""",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060079-10-1%3A2020%20CMV

These requirements are in addition to the requirements for installations in non-hazardous areas. This document applies to all electrical Ex Equipment including fixed, transportable, portable and personal, and installations, permanent or temporary. This document does not apply to:    electrical installations in mines susceptible to firedamp;    inherently explosive situations and dust from explosives or pyrophoric substances (for example explosives manufacturing and processing);    rooms used for medical purposes;    electrical installations in areas where the hazard is due to flammable mist; and    installation of non-electrical Ex Equipment (unless being part of an equipment assembly according IEC TS 60079-46). No account is taken in this document of the toxic hazards that are associated with flammable gases, liquids and dusts in concentrations that are usually very much less than the lower flammable limit. In locations where personnel could be exposed to potentially toxic concentrations of flammable material, appropriate precautions are necessary. Such precautions are outside the scope of this document. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.

IEC,IEC 60335-2-34:2021 RLV,Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-34: Particular requirements for motor-compressors,"""IEC 60335-2-34:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the official IEC Standard and its previous edition. IEC 60335-2-34:2021 deals with the safety of sealed (hermetic and semi-hermetic type) motor-compressors, their protection and control systems, if any, which are intended for use in equipment for household and similar purposes and which conform with the standards applicable to such equipment. It applies to motor-compressors tested separately, under the most severe conditions that may be expected to occur in normal use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase motor-compressors and 600 V for other motor-compressors. This standard also covers: - multi-speed motor-compressors, that are motor-compressors, the speed of which can be set to different values; - variable capacity motor-compressors that are motor-compressors where the capacity of the compressor is controlled at fixed speeds. Examples of equipment which contain motor-compressors are: - tumble dryers (IEC 60335-2-11); - refrigerating appliances, ice-cream appliances and ice-makers (IEC 60335-2-24); - electrical heat pumps, air-conditioners and dehumidifiers (IEC 60335-2-40); - commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines (IEC 60335-2-75); - commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or compressor (IEC 60335-2-89); - electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use (IEC 61010-2-011); - professional ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118); - refrigerating systems and heat pumps    Design, construction, testing, marking and documentation (ISO 5149-2). This standard does not supersede the requirements of standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the motor-compressor is used. However, if the motor-compressor type used complies with this standard, the tests for the motor-compressor specified in the particular appliance standard may not need to be made in the particular appliance or assembly. If the motor-compressor control system is associated with the particular appliance control system, additional tests could be necessary on the final appliance. So far as is practical, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by motor-compressors used in appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, it does not in general take into account: - the use of appliances by young children or infirm persons without supervision; - playing with the appliances by young children. Attention is drawn to the fact that: - for motor-compressors intended to be used in appliances in vehicles or on board ships, additional require ments could be necessary; - in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities. This standard does not apply to: - motor-compressors designed exclusively for industrial purposes; - motor-compressors used in appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas). If motor-compressors for refrigerant R-744 used in appliances with a transcritical refrigeration system are equipped with pressure relief devices, compliance with the requirements for these devices is checked during the tests on the final appliance. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: - it aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5.2; - application categories and tests have been extended (3.1.102, Annex AA); - use of a motorette for winding wire compatibility tests introduced (3.8.102, Annex BB); - height of the triangle, symbol ISO 7010 W021 has been introduced (7.14); - some notes are converted to normative text (1, 15.3, 22.21, 23.8, 29.3.4, Figure AA.1); - note in Subclause 6.101 becomes normative in Clause 11; - optional pressure endurance test introduced (18.101, Annex EE); - compatibility test for insulation inside the housing clarified (22.9); - clarification of clearances inside the housing for motor-compressors suitable for use at altitudes exceeding 2 000 m (29.1); - normative references and associated text have been updated (24.101, Annex DD); - breaking strength of tie cord after temperature heating cycle has been updated (Annex CC). This part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.

IEC 60335-2-51:2023 deals with the safety of electric stationary circulation pumps for house-hold and similar purposes intended for use in heating systems or in service water sys-tems, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances. The hydraulic and electrical parts of the pump can be in the same enclosure, so that the water flows through the motor and serves as a coolant, or they can be separated. Appliances not intended for normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by ap-pliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in gen-eral, it does not take into account: - persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction; - children playing with the appliance. Attention is drawn to the fact that - for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary; - in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authori-ties, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar au-thorities. This standard does not apply to - pumps for circulating liquids other than water; - pumps, other than circulation pumps (IEC 60335-2-41); - circulation pumps intended exclusively for industrial purposes; - circulation pumps intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour, or gas). This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the pre-vious edition: a) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020; b) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1); c) the use of separate connectors to ease the installation and establish the supply con-nection has been introduced (7.12.1, 22.102, 24.1.5, 24.1.101, 25.3); d) clarifications related to remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51). This part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.

IEC 60335-2-61:2024 deals with the safety of electric thermal-storage room heaters for household and similar purposes that are intended to heat the room in which they are located, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. Attention is drawn to the fact that - this standard only applies to self-contained thermal-storage room heaters. However, it can be used as a guide, in so far as it reasonably applies, to determine the requirements and test specifications for other thermal-storage room heaters; - for heaters incorporating direct-acting heating elements, IEC 60335-2-30 is also applicable; - for heaters intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary; - in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities. This standard does not apply to - appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes; - heaters incorporated in the building structure; - central heating systems; - heaters for saunas (IEC 60335-2-53); - flexible sheet heating elements for room heating (IEC 60335-2-96); - heaters intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas). This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2005 and Amendment 2:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: a) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020; b) deletion or conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1, 10.1, 19.3.102, 24.101); c) application of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2); d) temperature limits have been updated and requirements for measurement were defined (Clause 11.3, 11.8, Table 101); e) implementation of Figure 101 with the probe for measuring surface temperatures.

Ultrasonic welding is a form of cold friction welding that is becoming increasingly popular in many industries. This type of welding uses ultrasonic vibration to join materials together, creating a bond that is both strong and reliable. Ultrasonic welding has been identified as a process in ISO 4063-41 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The process of ultrasonic welding relies on high frequency ultrasound waves being used to create frictional heat at the connection point. High temperature is not required for this special method of welding, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to join two materials together. It also requires fewer steps than traditional methods, meaning it can be completed quickly and with minimal resources. Ultrasonic welding has been around for decades but only recently has become more widely utilized due to advances in technology and its availability at lower cost. It can be used on many different materials including plastics, rubbers, metals, textiles, and composites. Due to its precision and strong bonds it creates, it has become extremely popular in manufacturing processes such as automotive industry, electronics industry, furniture production and even medical device production. This document covers ultrasonically welded connections made with stranded or flexible wires (class 2, 5 or 6 per IEC 60228) of copper or copper alloy, as well as of aluminium or aluminium alloy. These welded metal-to-metal connections shall employ wires with cross-sectional area of 0,08 mm2 to 160 mm2 and shall not exceed a total cross-sectional area, in case of wire bundle, of 200 mm2. For aluminium or aluminium alloy wires, the minimum required cross-sectional area is 2,5 mm2. Additionally, information on materials, data from industrial experience and test procedures are included to ensure electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental conditions. Lastly, this document aims to achieve comparable results when using ultrasonic welding equipment with similar performance and specifications as specified by the termination manufacturer.""",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060352-9%3A2024

IEC,IEC 60601-1-9:2007+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2020 CSV,Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-9: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral Standard: Requirements for environmentally conscious design,"""IEC 60601-1-9:2007+A1:2013+A2:2020 The objective of this collateral standard is to improve the environmental impact for the entire range of medical electrical equipment, taking into account all stages of the product life cycle: - product specification; - design; - manufacturing; - sales, logistics, installation; - use; - end of life management. This means protecting the environment and human health from hazardous substances, conserving raw materials and energy, minimizing the generation of waste, as well as minimizing the adverse environmental impacts associated with waste. The criteria needed to reach this goal must be integrated into all stages of the medical electrical equipment life cycle from the specification stage to end of life management. The environmental impacts of me equipment through all life-cycle stages are determined from the medical electrical equipment""s environmental aspects defined during the identification of need, product planning, and design stages. Consideration of environmental aspects as early as possible in these stages can produce numerous benefits that might include lower costs, stimulation of innovation and creativity, and increased knowledge about the product. It can also provide new business opportunities, and improved product quality as well as reduction of adverse environmental impacts. The assessment of the environmental aspects and impacts of medical electrical equipment is a developing science and it is anticipated that this collateral standard will require periodic updating as the science develops. The requirements given in this collateral standard do not replace national or international laws and regulations. Environmental protection is one element of the overall risk management process as required by the general standard. The acceptability of medical electrical equipment""s environmental impacts are balanced against other factors, such as the product""s intended function, performance, safety, cost, marketability, quality, legal and regulatory requirements. This balance can differ depending on the intended function of the medical electrical equipment. For example, a solution appropriate for life-saving or life-supporting medical electrical equipment might not be appropriate for a device intended to correct a minor ailment. A manufacturer of medical electrical equipment might have to justify, as a result of risk management, that a medical benefit outweighs the associated adverse environmental impacts. This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2007), its amendment 1 (2013) and its amendment 2 (2020).

Anti-Scatter Grids are used to reduce the incidence of scattered radiation, produced particularly in the body of the patient, upon the image reception area and thus to improve the contrast of the X-ray pattern. This International Standard specifies the definitions, determination and indication of characteristics of anti-scatter grids. In this standard only linear grids are considered. Since at present only focused grids are used in mammography, this standard is restricted to focused grids where mammographic anti-scatter grids are concerned. This standard is not intended to be applied for acceptance tests. This standard does not cover the homogeneity of performance over the area of a grid. This standard is intended to be applied for the determination of the characteristics of anti-scatter grids under test conditions. These conditions are not usually available at the site of the responsible organization. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2001, and constitutes a technical revision. In this revision calcium tungstate phosphor fluorescent screens, which are no longer available, have been replaced by gadolinium oxysulphide (GOS) fluorescent screens. Further, a new quality parameter is introduced: the Image Improvement Factor or Q-factor, which better describes the properties of the anti-scatter grid, especially for digital detector applications. Further differences between this third edition and the previous second edition are: - new instrumentation is prescribed for measurements of the transmission of primary radiation, the transmission of scattered radiation and the transmission of total radiation, because fluorescent screens made of calcium tungstate phosphors are outdated and are no longer available; - the definition of the phantom used for measurements of the transmission of primary radiation, the transmission of scattered radiation and the transmission of total radiation is modified and references to IEC 61267 are omitted; - and the radiation conditions used for the measurements have been adapted and are now the RQR and RQR-M conditions specified in IEC 61267:2005.""",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2060627%3A2013

IEC,IEC 60976:2007,Medical electrical equipment - Medical electron accelerators - Functional performance characteristics,"""Applies to medical electron accelerators when used, for therapy purposes, in human medical practice. This standard applies to medical electron accelerators which deliver a radiation beam of either X-radiation or electron radiation with nominal energies in the range 1 MeV to 50 MeV at maximum absorbed dose rates between 0,001 Gy s-1 and 1 Gy s-1 at 1 m from the radiation source and at normal treatment distances between 50 cm and 200 cm from the radiation source. The present standard describes measurements and test procedures to be performed by the manufacturer at the design and construction stage of a medical electron accelerator but does not specify acceptance tests to be performed after installation at the purchaser""s site. The accompanying report, IEC 60977, however, does suggest that many of the test procedures are appropriate for acceptance tests. The measurement conditions described in the present standard differ from those previously in use. This applies particularly to the phantom position for measurements and the measurement of distances from the isocentre. These new conditions should be substituted for and not be added to previous methods. This standard specifies test procedures for the determination and disclosure of functional performance characteristics, knowledge of which is deemed necessary for proper application and use of a medical electron accelerator and which are to be declared in the accompanying documents together with the greatest deviation or variation to be expected under specific conditions in normal use. A format for presentation of functional performance values is given in Annex A. It is recognized that inaccuracies in the test methods must be allowed for when assessing performance. However, it was not felt to be advisable to combine the errors into an overall performance tolerance but to keep them separate in the expectation that more accurate test methods will be evolved. It is not intended that this standard should in any way inhibit the future development of new designs of equipment which may have operating modes and parameters different from those described herein, provided that such equipment achieves equivalent levels of performance for the treatment of patients. Except where otherwise stated this standard assumes that the medical electron accelerators have an isocentric gantry. Where the equipment is non-isocentric, the description of performance and test methods may need to be suitably adapted. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1989.

Manufacturers, medical researchers, policy makers, users, and other interested parties involved with different aspects of ESWs use a variety of different measurement methods, different terminologies, and different parameters to measure and describe the performance of an ESW. These differences generate confusion and misunderstanding within this stakeholder community, and this impacts the ability to perform accurate, reliable, and reproducible measurement comparisons. By developing a generally-accepted terminology, set of performance parameters, and test methods, this standard will facilitate accurate and precise communication for the parameters that describe the electrical output, current and high voltage, of ESWs. This improved communication will aid this stakeholder community in collectively developing uniform methods for describing the ESW output and its effect on human physiology consistently and accurately, thereby enabling the development of safe use performance standards/regulations by the appropriate standardization body.""",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=IEC%2062792%3A2015

Image measurement and interpretation workstations are included. This document includes minimum sets of such tests intended for frequent users of medical ultrasound systems, for quality assurance professionals in their organizations, or those hired from other quality-control and/or service-provider organizations. The procedures are for a wide range of more common diagnostic ultrasound systems, currently operating from 1 MHz to 40 MHz, although available phantoms meet the specifications only from 1 MHz to 23 MHz. The tests are defined in three levels, with the simplest and most cost-effective performed most frequently: - Level 1 comprises five quick tests/observations to be performed daily to monthly by those normally operating the systems. - Level 2 includes one necessary test for all systems in addition to those of Level 1, two Level 1 tests performed more rigorously, two tests that are for special situations or equipment, and one that is just optional, included because it is highly developed. Level 2 tests are performed annually by those with meaningful quality assurance training. - Level 3 extends the two special situations tests to all systems, adds one optional test and includes a periodic review of the QA programme. Frequent distance-measurement accuracy tests are recommended in this document only for certain classes of position encoding that are not now known to be highly stable and without bias. QA in all dimensions is recommended in this document as the first test for such systems. The test methodology is applicable for transducers operating in the 1 MHz to 23 MHz frequency range.

IEC,ISO/IEC 5927:2024,"Computer graphics, image processing and environmental data representation - Augmented and virtual reality safety - Guidance on safe immersion, set up and usage","""This document specifies how augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) devices are to be set up and used in the enterprise workplace in a manner that ensures health and safety (H&S) is maintained, H&S consequences are understood, and additional risks are not introduced. Within this concept of safe usage, there is particular focus on guidance around safe immersion (time) and safety in the workplace. This document defines the concepts of AR, VR, the virtuality continuum and other associated terms such as augmented virtuality and mixed reality. This document provides guidance on: a) setting up AR systems; b) setting up VR systems; c) safe usage and immersion in AR systems both in the consumer and enterprise domains; d) safe usage and immersion in VR systems both in the consumer and enterprise domains. This document focuses on visual aspects of AR and VR. Other modes such as haptics and olfactory are not addressed within this document. This document covers both the hardware (the physical AR/VR head mounted displays) and areas of visual stimulus (the environments and graphics displayed in those headsets). This document does not cover all possible visual stimulus scenarios; focus is directed toward those areas that are known to have implications on safe use. This specifically includes the source vection (visual illusion of self-motion in physically stationary AR/VR users) and/or motion (physical movement of AR/VR users) and associated safe use considerations.

IEC,ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000,Information technology - Programming languages - Guide for the use of the Ada programming language in high integrity systems,"""1 Scope This Technical Report provides guidance on the use of Ada when producing high integrity systems. In producing such applications it is usually the case that adherence to guidelines or standards has to be demonstrated to independent bodies. These guidelines or standards vary according to the application area, industrial sector or nature of the risk involved. For safety applications, the international generic standard is [IEC 61508] of which part 3 is concerned with software. For security systems, the multi-national generic assessment guide is [ISO CD 15408]. For sector-specific guidance and standards there are: Airborne civil avionics: [DO-178B] Nuclear power plants: [IEC 880] Medical systems: [IEC 601-4] Pharmaceutical: [GAMP] For national/regional guidance and standards there are the following: UK Defence: [DS 00-55] European rail: [EN 50128] European security: [ITSEC] US nuclear: [NRC] UK automotive: [MISRA] US medical: [FDA] US space: [NASA] The above standards and guides are referred to as Standards in this Technical Report. The above list is not exhaustive but indicative of the type of Standard to which this Technical Report provides guidance. The specific Standards above are not addressed individually but this Technical Report is synthesized from an analysis of their requirements and recommendations. 1.1 Within the scope This Technical Report assumes that a system is being developed in Ada to meet a standard listed above or one of a similar nature. The primary goal of this Technical Report is to translate general requirements into Ada specific ones. For example, a general standard might require that dynamic testing provides evidence of the execution of all the statements in the code of the application. In the case of generics, this is interpreted by this Technical Report to mean all instantiations of the generic should be executed. ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000 (E) 2   ISO/IEC 2000 - All rights reserved This Technical Report is intended to provide guidance only, and hence there are no ?shalls"". However, this Technical Report identifies verification and validation issues which should be resolved and documented according to the sector-specific standards being employed. The following topics are within the scope of this Technical Report: _ the choice of features of the language which aid verification and compliance to the standards, _ identification of language features requiring additional verification steps, _ the use of tools to aid design and verification, _ issues concerning qualification of compilers for use on high integrity applications, _ tools, such as graphic design tools, which generate Ada source code which is accessible to users. Tools which generate Ada source code require special consideration. Where generated code may be modified or extended, verification of the extensions and overall system will be assisted if the guidelines have been taken into account. Even where modification is not planned, inspection and analysis of the generated code may be unavoidable unless the generator is trusted or ?qualified"" according to an applicable standard. Finally, even if generated code is neither modified nor inspected, the overall verification process may be made more complicated if the code deviates from guidelines intended to facilitate testing and analysis. Potential users of such tools should evaluate their code generation against the guidance provided in this Technical Report. 1.2 Out of scope The following topics are considered to be out of scope with respect to this Technical Report: _ Domain-specific standards, _ Application-specific issues, _ Hardware and system-specific issues, _ Human factor""",https://webstore.iec.ch/en/iec-search/result?q=ISO/IEC%20TR%2015942%3A2000
