ISO,ISO 19289:2015,Air quality  Meteorology  Siting classifications for surface observing stations on land,"ISO 19289:2015 indicates exposure rules for various sensors, but what should be done when these conditions are not fulfilled? There are sites that do not respect the recommended exposure rules. Consequently, a classification has been established to help determine the given site's representativeness on a small scale (impact of the surrounding environment). 
The classification process helps the actors and managers of a network to better take into consideration the exposure rules and thus it often improves the siting. At least, the siting environment is known and documented in the metadata. It is obviously possible and recommended to fully document the site but the risk is that a fully documented site might increase the complexity of the metadata, which would often restrict their operational use. That is why this siting classification is defined to condense the information and facilitate the operational use of this metadata information.
A site as a whole has no single classification number. Each parameter being measured at a site has its own class and is sometimes different from the others. If a global classification of a site is required, the maximum value of the parameters' classes can be used. 
In ISO 19289:2015, the classification is (occasionally) completed with an estimated uncertainty due to siting, which has to be added in the uncertainty budget of the measurement. This estimation is coming from bibliographic studies and/or some comparative tests.
The primary objective of this classification is to document the presence of obstacles close to the measurement site.",https://www.iso.org/standard/64287.html,Published

ISO,ISO 9308-2:2012,Water quality  Enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria  Part 2: Most probable number method,"ISO 9308-2:2012 specifies a method for the enumeration of E. coli and coliform bacteria in water. The method is based on the growth of target organisms in a liquid medium and calculation of the ""Most Probable Number"" (MPN) of organisms by reference to MPN tables. This method can be applied to all types of water, including those containing an appreciable amount of suspended matter and high background counts of heterotrophic bacteria. However it must not be used for the enumeration of coliform bacteria in marine water. When using for the enumeration of E. coli in marine waters, a 1→10 dilution in sterile water is typically  required, although the method has been shown to work well with some marine waters that have a lower than normal concentration of salts. In the absence of data to support the use of the method without dilution, a 1→10 dilution is used.
This method relies upon the detection of E. coli based upon expression of the enzyme b‑D‑glucuronidase and consequently does not detect many of the enterohaemorhagic strains of E. coli, which do not typically express this enzyme. Additionally, there are a small number of other E. coli strains that do not express b‑D‑glucuronidase.
The choice of tests used in the detection and confirmation of the coliform group of bacteria, including E. coli, can be regarded as part of a continuous sequence. The extent of confirmation with a particular sample depends partly on the nature of the water and partly on the reasons for the examination. The test described in ISO 9308-2:2012 provides a confirmed result with no requirement for further confirmation of positive wells.",https://www.iso.org/standard/52246.html,Published
