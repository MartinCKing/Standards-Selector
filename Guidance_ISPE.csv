The US FDA CDRH (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) Case for Quality program identified that an excessive focus on compliance rather than quality may divert resources and management attention toward meeting regulatory compliance requirements rather than adopting best quality practices. This may also deter investment in automation and digital technologies that could assist in quality improvements and process control. The ISPE GAMP Good Practice Guide: Enabling InnovationCritical Thinking, Agile, IT Service Managementprovides information to support the adoption of new and improved approaches to software engineering, data management, and “as a Service” offerings (XaaS), including the use of supporting tools. This helps regulated companies facilitate the best use of resources and encourages the application of appropriate and proportionate practices. This GAMP Good Practice Guide discusses how critical thinking based on product and process knowledge and quality risk management can enable the removal of barriers to the introduction of new and innovative technologies. Practical considerations are presented, such as ways to increase the maturity level of an organization’s critical thinking ability, the appropriate use of requirements management and traceability tools to eliminate duplicating documentation as audit evidence, and the use of scripted and unscripted testing for maximum effectiveness. A large percentage of organizations developing software use Agile methods, and the ability for regulated companies to leverage these techniques in the GxP environment is essential to encourage innovation.  ISPE GAMP 5 supports the use of incremental, iterative, and evolutionary approaches, including Agile, for product development and development of custom applications. The ISPE GAMP  Good Practice Guide: Enabling InnovationCritical Thinking, Agile, IT Service Managementillustrates how Agile software methodology can be implemented in a way that is completely aligned with GxP. Systems hosted in the cloud are increasingly used to support GxP processes, and regulated companies need to understand the quality and compliance implications in order to deal with them effectively and efficiently. Regulated companies cannot delegate their regulatory accountabilities to an IT/IS service provider; however, they may leverage the knowledge, experience, activities, and artifacts of an IT/IS service provider through risk-based assessment, management, and governance processes. A discussion of good practices in these areas is provided in this Guide, including examples of where information security standards/industry guidance are aligned with GxP requirements. The guide shows the benefits offered by adopting innovative practices combined with the experience and knowledge of the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to identify how best to realize the opportunities to provide process, services (and products) that are fit for their intended use and can be efficiently maintained in a state of control.

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,GAMP RDI Good Practice Guide: Data Integrity by Design,"Data Integrity by Design is the concept that data integrity must be incorporated from the initial planning of a business process through to the implementation, operation, and retirement of computerized systems supporting that business process. It promotes the application of critical thinking to identify how data flows through the business process and to proactively assess and mitigate risks across both the system and data lifecycles. It emphasizes data integrity as foundational to protecting patient safety and product quality. This ISPE GAMP  RDI Good Practice Guide: Data Integrity by Designsupports organizations as they embrace and implement a holistic approach by leveraging data governance and knowledge management activities to drive continual improvement in data integrity. The Guide promotes a patient-centric mindset, focusing resources and management attention on quality best practices that inherently facilitate meeting regulatory compliance requirements. This Guide provides a bridge between the system lifecycle approach defined in  ISPE GAMP  5: A Risk-Based Approach to Compliant GxP Computerized Systems, and the data lifecycle approach in the  ISPE GAMP  Guide: Records and Data Integrity. Data integrity can only be achieved when both lifecycle approaches are adopted, understood, and actively managed. Several new areas are covered in this Guide. One such topic is Knowledge Management (KM), which can be considered the link between data governance and quality risk management. KM enables organizations to make decisions more efficiently and encourages an organizational culture of learning. Many instrument devices such as filter integrity testers and pH meters have moved from a simple display of the measured value to temporarily storing electronic records. This evolution has resulted in increasing regulatory awareness of the data integrity risk posed by such devices lacking the sophisticated technical controls inherent in larger computerized systems. The  ISPE GAMP  RDI Good Practice Guide: Data Integrity by Design offers a pragmatic, practical approach to the identification and remediation of the risks, and endorses the adoption of working practices to protect and review the electronic records. In an industry first, members of the Computer Software Assurance (CSA) team (responsible for working with the FDA to develop the draft guidance on this topic) have collaborated closely with  ISPE GAMP  subject matter experts to create an appendix to the  ISPE GAMP  RDI Good Practice Guide: Data Integrity by Design. This appendix details the key concepts of CSA and provides illustrative case studies of its application.

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Good Practice Guide: Continuous Manufacturing of Oral Solid Dosage Forms,"When the pharmaceutical industry began to apply the principles of continuous processing to the manufacture of Oral Solid Dosage (OSD) forms in the mid-2000s, the industry initially focused on establishing the technical capabilities of continuous manufacturing systems. It has now advanced to the commercial manufacture of multiple drug products with distribution approved in the US, Europe, and other countries. The consensus among experienced practitioners is that the continuous approach has numerous benefits. It is often more robust than its batch counterpart, it is designed for reduced variability, and it can achieve improved product quality through better blend uniformity. However, there are still many challenges to widespread adoption. The  ISPE OSD Community of Practice formed a working team in 2017 to advance the use of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry and to increase the long-term efficiency and affordability of the manufacture of OSD products. The team, comprised of end user pharmaceutical companies, equipment vendors, and academics, set out to establish equipment requirements, identify opportunities for harmonization and flexible integration, and suggest enhancements to current equipment. The collective output forms the basis for this Guide. This Guide reviews the unit operations typically employed in continuous manufacturing and aims to establish a set of minimum equipment requirements for each system to function as part of an integrated process train. While most of the units are well-understood and used in batch manufacturing, the Guide considers the changes in physical and automation requirements that will allow each unit to work in concert as part of a successful continuous manufacturing platform. Operations unique to CM, loss-in-weight feeding and continuous blending, are discussed, including how these systems affect upstream and downstream operations. Automation control systems typically deployed to run fully integrated continuous lines are addressed, as well as Process Analytical Technology (PAT) measurement systems used to provide feedback on the process or materials. The aim is to set the framework for a future standard approach to a modular automation design for continuous manufacturing lines that greatly reduces the need for custom logic and accelerates the timeline through validation. As more companies integrate continuous manufacturing into their development and commercial operations, an increased demand for more flexible, modular, and robust systems accommodating a wider range of products and production control strategies is anticipated. This Guide provides a valuable resource for new and existing companies as they design and integrate continuous processing equipment into their operations, highlighting best practices and opportunities for enhancement to both vendors and end-users already engaged in developing continuous manufacturing lines of the future.

Specific potential benefits include facilitation of speed-to-market of regulated products through efficient delivery of manufacturing facilities and systems and an optimized level of quality oversight, commensurate with the maturity of established GEP. The ISPE Good Practice Guide: Good Engineering Practice (Second Edition)defines the practices and processes under GEP that support and enable the design, delivery, and operation of engineered systems. The scope of GEP covers the complete lifecycle of engineering projects and engineered systems from conceptual design to retirement. This Guide considers the entire range of pharmaceutical engineering activity and identifies key attributes of GEP within it, including how GEP relates to and interfaces with GxP. Updates for the second edition include alignment with current industry practice, particularly with respect to the  ISPE Baseline  Guide: Commissioning and Qualification (Second Edition) which incorporates ASTM E2500, EU GMP Annex 15, ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10, and applicable regulatory guidance. This Good Practice Guide incorporates the concepts and application of Quality Risk Management (QRM), specifically the application of GEP as an enabler for QRM-based integrated Commissioning and Qualification (C&Q). The structure of the Guide divides GEP activity into the following categories: This Guide was developed through the collaboration of representative professionals from various sectors and geographic regions of the pharmaceutical industry with the intention of determining a common understanding of the concept and principles of GEP.

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Good Practice Guide: IMP Reverse Logistics,"Every year the number of clinical trials conducted across the globe rises in a concerted effort to develop new or improved medicinal products that ultimately improve lives. The pharmaceutical industry has developed standards and best practices in almost every aspect of a trial. There is, however, one area that lacks foundational best practices: that of medicinal product accountability, reconciliation, and return for destruction, otherwise known as reverse logistics. Most current reverse logistics processes lack effective planning, thorough application of risk management, and well-defined roles and responsibilities. This results in inefficient and costly processes that often cause delays in study closure as failure to account for study materials can affect the acceptability of trial data. Establishing better standards is also complicated by gaps in and lack of harmonization between Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), local environmental laws and regulations, and import/export and customs regulations. The first such guidance in the pharmaceutical industry, this  ISPE Good Practice Guide: Investigational Medicinal Product Reverse LogisticsGood Returns and Reconciliation Practices describes steps that can be taken to plan for and implement a successful reverse logistics process within any investigational product supply chain. It provides a clear outline of the aspects to consider to effectively manage investigational product returns. Written by top experts in the field, the Guide discusses the key requirements of a good reverse logistics process and common pitfalls to avoid. Topics covered include regulations, product characteristics, trial conduct considerations, logistics, and the use of technology, highlighting what has been successful in the industry. Additionally, a timeline of activities is presented as an example checklist of best practices. The Guide promotes the development of a company policy applicable to all clinical trials. This policy should determine which Quality Assurance organization, GCP or GMP, governs which process. Deciding this can be especially challenging when an audit or inspection finding is noted, or when deviations are evaluated, as practices in each Quality group may be different. A good policy directs which Quality area has jurisdiction, so it clear which standard operating procedures are to be followed. Emphasizing planning for issues before the study starts, the Guide offers suggestions for situations such as what to do if importing a drug for destruction is not possible, or if there are changes in site capabilities during the trial. Additionally, scenarios are given in the Guide to help organizations prepare for potential issues. For example, if the investigational medicine is a controlled substance and the patient reports losing a pill down the sink, how will discrepancies like this be treated? The  ISPE Good Practice Guide: Investigational Medicinal Product Reverse LogisticsGood Returns and Reconciliation Practices is the first collection of best practices in the area of Investigational Product Management. It uses the general assumption of working with solid-dosage forms, as they form the majority of experience in the industry; however, alternative dosage forms and their special considerations are addressed. This Guide will help organizations effectively plan and implement reverse logistics policies and processes within their investigational product supply chain organization.",https://ispe.org/publications/guidance-documents/good-practice-guide-imp-reverse-logistics,

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in Pharmaceutical Industry,"ICH Q10 outlines three objectives: achieve product realization, establish and maintain a state of control, and facilitate continual improvement. Embracing these objectives can be best achieved using the dual enablers, Knowledge Management (KM) and Quality Risk Management (QRM). The first reference to KM in the field of pharmaceutical quality was in ICH Q8 in 2005 as a tool used with QRM for a more systematic Quality by Design (QbD) approach to development throughout the product lifecycle. Three years later, ICH Q10 identified KM and QRM as the enablers of an effective Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS). Since then, the pharmaceutical industry has made significant progress in adopting QRM into systems and processes. However, the industry has been slow in implementing KM, thus missing the quality, operational, and employee engagement advantages KM practices have to offer. The ISPE Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in the Pharmaceutical Industrydiscusses how KM can enable a more effective PQS. The first such guidance in the pharmaceutical industry, the Guide promotes uniting KM with QRM to enable better risk-based decisions, and shows how KM can enhance nearly every element of the PQS across the product lifecycle. In addition, there are substantial and compelling benefits of effective KM beyond the quality system, such as improved business performance by increasing efficiency, building more robust processes, facilitating continual improvement, and creating an engaged knowledge workforce. In other industries, KM is widely recognized as a stand-alone discipline. To help the pharmaceutical industry progress, this Guide presents the importance and associated benefits of effective KM, and includes definitions, principles, and supporting concepts. The Guide provides numerous references to other industries that have successfully adopted and maintained KM programs as part of their routine business processes. The Guide also contains pharmaceutical industry-specific case studies that show why the KM initiative was started, how obstacles were overcome, and how the methods and tools implemented made the KM program sustainable. The ISPE Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in the Pharmaceutical Industryplaces an emphasis on tacit knowledgeoften referred to as know-how and know-why. A systematic KM program that manages tacit knowledge is a powerful tool to help maximize knowledge awareness and minimize knowledge loss that can threaten business continuity. This Guide aims to highlight the importance and impact of tacit knowledge, and where appropriate, provide KM methods and tools to better recognize, capture, transfer, and apply tacit knowledge. The Getting Started section of the Guide presents clear and pragmatic activities to foster the first steps for a KM effort, including advice to start small and ways to measure progress. Data volume is also covered in the ISPE Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in the Pharmaceutical Industry. The amount of data, information, and knowledge available today is huge and expected to grow exponentially. Without technology, human beings cannot manage this increasing volume of data along with its variety and complexity. The Guide explores the potential of digitalization and Pharma 4.0™ enabling technologies in support of the evolution of data, information, and KM as part of a solution inclusive of people, business processes, and governance. Some of the many methods and tools presented and discussed in this Guide include: Other key takeaways include: Establishing an effective KM strategy requires a change from current business practices and ways of working for most organizations but implementing a culture embracing KM is an advantage to all aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. The  ISPE Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in the Pharmaceutical Industry discusses organizational change management to facilitate colleague engagement and ensure people understand the reasons to focus on KM and successfully adopt more effective ways of working. The practical principles, methods, and tools provided in this Guide will help organizations improve their capabilities in managing knowledge and using that knowledge to support an effective PQS resulting in improved PQS outcomes (e.g., better risk-based decision making) and operational performance, among other benefits. Quality Risk Management (QRM) and Knowledge Management (KM) are the enablers of an effective Pharmaceutical Quality System. But are companies integrating these disciplines well? A survey conducted in February 2021 suggests not. The Risk-Knowledge Infinity Cycle (RKI Cycle) framework, which can be applied across the entire product lifecycle, has been proposed, to better integrate QRM and KM. The survey results also suggest that implementing a framework such as the RKI Cycle to better unite QRM and KM has the potential to enable a variety of significant benefits including better risk-based decisions, improved control strategies, and more. Providing supplemental information to the  ISPE Good Practice Guide: Knowledge Management in the Pharmaceutical Industry, this paper, “Exploring the Risk-Knowledge Infinity Cycle (RKI Cycle) across the Product Lifecycle” takes a deeper look into the inverse relationship between risk and knowledge application. Increased knowledge provides improved understanding, which leads to decreased uncertainty. And when knowledge is applied appropriately, there is lower risk. The paper presents the RKI Cycle as a cohesion of QRM and KM by defining a stepwise integrated and cyclical process, where an organization continually seeks to maximize knowledge and minimize risk. Short case studies in the Commercial Manufacturing and Technology Transfer lifecycle phases demonstrate the practical application of the RKI Cycle and its associated concepts.",https://ispe.org/publications/guidance-documents/good-practice-guide-knowledge-management-pharmaceutical-industry,

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Guide: ATMPs - Allogeneic Cell Therapy,"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) are based on genes, cells, or tissues delivered to patients to provide a therapeutic benefit based on a specific target of interest. For ATMPs, the therapy is cells, engineered tissues, or the manipulation of the patient’s genome. This is in contrast with traditional manufacturing processes for compounds that are synthetically derived (i.e., small molecule) or proteins or peptides expressed by cellular systems (i.e., large molecule biopharmaceuticals). The development, regulatory path, facility design, qualification, and manufacture of ATMPs present significant challenges to manufacturers, engineers, and suppliers. The GMP regulations are evolving as novel processes are presented and manufacturing paradigms are being tested. This Guide addresses facility engineering issues that are most applicable at the time of publication, as based on the experience of the authors. This Guide focuses primarily on allogeneic cell therapies, specifically manufacturing facility development and design. Allogeneic cell therapies have unique challenges due to the small manufacturing scale, limitations in scale-up, the need to manufacture multiple lots of products concurrently, and the need for flexibility to accommodate a varied and evolving product portfolio. This Guide covers common challenges with allogeneic cell therapy facilities, design concepts specific to allogeneic cell therapy facilities, and GMP layout and architectural design development. Key aspects of the allogeneic cell therapy manufacturing process, including sampling, QC, and process understanding, are presented. Not included in the scope of this Guide are the following areas: While this Guide focuses on allogeneic cell therapies to the greatest extent possible, the authors recognize a significant amount of content is applicable to other types of ATMPs, particularly around regulatory compliance, technology transfer, utilities, HVAC, and supply chain. The framework of this Guide has been built upon the  ISPE Guide: Advanced Therapy Medicinal ProductsAutologous Cell Therapy in order to create cohesive content between the two modalities that have significant overlaps.

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Guide: ATMPs - Autologous Cell Therapy,"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) therapies include cells, engineered tissues, or the manipulation of the patient’s genome. This is in contrast with traditional manufacturing processes for compounds that are synthetically derived (i.e., small molecule) or proteins or peptides expressed by cellular systems (i.e., large molecule biopharmaceuticals). ATMPs are based on genes, cells, or tissues delivered to patients to provide a therapeutic benefit based on a specific target of interest. There are two general primary focus areas for ATMPs: This Guide acknowledges that the term ATMP is quite broad and that these are emerging therapies utilizing rapidly evolving technology and equipment. In recognition of this, this Guide focuses on autologous cell therapies while providing content that may be applicable to other types of ATMPs. This Guide focuses primarily on manufacturing facility development and design for autologous cell therapies for parenteral use. This Guide provides an overview of the critical aspects of ATMP facility design as well as the key relationship between current process/facility attribute alignment and how that changes in the ATMP space.

ISPE,ISPE Guidance,Guide: ATMPs - rAAV Comparability & Lifecycle Mgmt,"As gene therapy products race towards the clinic and commercial launch, sponsor companies are faced with significant hurdles posed by evolving manufacturing platforms, process improvements across multiple stages of development, and a rapidly growing tool kit for the characterization of viral vectors. Taken together, this creates a complex landscape for demonstrating comparability driven by process changes. Further, a lack of specific regulatory guidance on viral vector comparability studies pushes gene therapy companies to adapt and interpret principles of ICH Q5E for demonstrating comparability of biological products when changes are made in their manufacturing processes. As ICH Q5E guidelines are not fit for purpose in the context of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP), different approaches have been adopted across the industry to define comparability studies. The  ISPE Guide: ATMPs - Recombinant AAV Comparability and Lifecycle Management considers requirements and guidance for recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) manufacturing and comparability from the US FDA, EU EudraLex Volume 4 Part IV, EMA Q&A, and ICH Q5E. Drawing on a team of industry experts with global experience, the Guide provides current understanding and best practices on rAAV comparability exercises, offering manufacturers a standardized approach for developing process and product comparability strategies. It provides considerations for evaluating rAAV vector products comparability pre and post-change to the manufacturing process and proposes strategies to address the unique challenges posed by this new class of products. The Guide is intended as a reference and practical guide for addressing common challenges that may arise when demonstrating comparability across the rAAV product lifecycle. It discusses host cell type selection, rAAV gene delivery methods, and the advantages, disadvantages, and impact on upstream and downstream operations, including differences in impurity profiles depending on the platform used. Comparison of scale-out versus scale-up of unit operations is included. An extensive list of analytical techniques applicable to rAAV comparability studies is explored that should support virtually any type of rAAV product comparability study. Process changes may occur throughout product development and after approval for various reasons. While a comprehensive list assigning risk to specific process changes is not possible given the product-dependent nature of these risks, the Guide contains general observations about levels of risk associated with common changes. Strategies for considering this knowledge with the analytical tools presented to develop comparability studies at various stages in the product lifecycle are described. In addition, the Guide presents three realistic case studies for changes likely to be encountered during an rAAV product’s lifecycle. They cover various phases, pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial, detailing changes, how to assess them, what kind of development and characterization data should be generated, how the data informs the comparability protocol, and what additional considerations should be included in the comparability protocol.
