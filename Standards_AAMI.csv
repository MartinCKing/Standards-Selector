AAMI,AAMI CR34971:2022 [HISTORICAL],Guidance on the Application of ISO 14971 to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,"This document provides guidance and intends to serve as a companion to ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2019 for those performing risk management for artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) incorporating medical devices.

This AAMI Consensus Report does not provide a new risk management process, nor does it expand the requirements of ISO 14971. Rather, it provides guidance to assist those who are applying ISO 14971 to regulated AI medical technologies.

There are many different algorithms that can support AI, including technologies such as decision trees, genetic algorithms, and neural nets. Often, when people are discussing AI, they are specifically talking about Machine Learning systems. Since Machine Learning (ML) systems are often more complicated and more opaque than other approaches, this report focuses on ML-related risks.

This document has been superseded by AAMI TIR34971:2023; Application of ISO 14971 to machine learning in artificial intelligenceâ€”Guide.

Given the size and complexity of the IEC 60601 series, it is a challenge to gain more than a superficial understanding of what the 60601 series of standards encompasses, let alone why it matters. Therefore, a key objective of this document is to provide stakeholders with sufficient information about the 60601 series to grasp its significance and value. At the same time, it is important to know what the 60601 series excludes, so that stakeholders can understand the role it plays in the broader context of assuring the safety and effectiveness of MEE/MESs. This document is intended to clarify and to point out the importance of the series as well as to provide guidance to understanding and to implementing the series.",https://store.aami.org/s/store?_gl=1*1t8pqua*_gcl_au*NzcxMTM3NDg2LjE3MjczMjY5NDI.*_ga*MTQ3NDU1MzMyLjE3MjczMjY5NDI.*_ga_PMV3KJP116*MTcyNzM0MTcyNy4yLjEuMTcyNzM0MTczMi4wLjAuMA..#/store/browse/detail/a152E000006j678QAA
